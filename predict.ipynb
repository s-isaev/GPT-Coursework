The EU has added 15 individuals and 18 entities to its sanctions list targeting Russians linked to the separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine. Igor Sechin (US sanctions) The head of Russia's leading integrated oil and gas company Rosneft has shown utter loyalty to Mr Putin, according to US officials. Sergei Chemezov (EU and US sanctions) The director of the Rostec high-technology state corporation, Mr Chemezov has known Mr Putin since the 1980s when they lived in the same apartment complex in East Germany. He is also the personal banker for senior officials of the Russian Federation, including Mr Putin, according to the US Treasury. Ramzan Kadyrov (EU sanctions) The Russian-backed President of Chechnya has voiced strong support for the rebels and for Russia's annexation of Crimea. Sergei Glazyev (US and EU sanctions) Widely regarded as Mr Putin's chief adviser on Ukraine, he talked openly of intervening militarily a month before Russian troops moved into Crimea. In 2004, he headed Mr Putin's election campaign. Mr Bortnikov gave no details of how and where the suspects were detained, in the brief statement carried by Russia's state-owned Channel One, but he did say the investigation was continuing. One Russian MP, Nikolai Kovalyov, told Ria-Novosti news agency that the key thing was to \"find out who ordered this assassination\". 12 Nov - Beirut, Lebanon Suicide bombers kill at least 43 people. 31 Oct - Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt Plane crashes killing all 224 on board. Russia says a bomb caused the crash and an IS affiliate says it was responsible. 26 Jun - Kuwait City, Kuwait Suicide attack kills at least 27 people. 22 May - Qatif, Saudi Arabia Two suicide bombs kill at least 21 people. 21 Mar - Sanaa, Yemen Suicide bombings kill at least 137 people. 18 Mar - Tunis, Tunisia Gunmen kill 19 people, mostly foreign tourists. This was based on reports on the Russian media which we now believe to be incorrect. On Tuesday, Russia's security chief Alexander Bortnikov told President Vladimir Putin the bomb equivalent to up to 1kg of TNT had been planted on board the Metrojet Airbus 321 that crashed in the Sinai peninsula on 31 October. The FBI also has its own investigation on the issue. Sunday's conversation between the two presidents marks the second time the two men have spoken in a week. Informally known as the \"Putin list\", the unclassified section has 210 names, 114 of them in the government or linked to it, or key businessmen. Internationally known oligarchs are there too, such as those with stakes in top English football clubs: Alisher Usmanov (Arsenal) and Roman Abramovich (Chelsea). Even before the list was made public, the Kremlin had claimed the US Treasury report was an attempt to meddle in Russia's presidential election. Moscow won't want that to become a Who's Sanctioned. Earlier on Monday, the US government argued the Caatsa law had already pushed governments around the world to cancel deals with Russia worth billions, suggesting that more sanctions were not required. Agents of the military spy service GRU also gather intelligence abroad. The Spanish prosecutor, Jose Grinda, told US officials that Russia's security services \"control OC (organised crime) in Russia\" and \"the FSB is 'absorbing' the Russian mafia\". The EU says the defence ministry controls chemical weapon stocks pending their planned destruction. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any role in the attack on Mr Navalny and rejects the Western allegation that he was poisoned with Novichok, an extremely toxic chemical that, experts say, could only have come from a Russian state facility. Security and arms expert Mark Galeotti told BBC Russian that no-one should conclude from the Navalny video that \"Russia is an incompetent country filled with semi-educated agents\", pointing out that the Bellingcat investigation coincided with a large-scale hacking of US government agencies.

Mr Berezovsky is claiming Mr Abramovich intimidated him into selling shares in Russian oil company Sibneft at a fraction of their value. Mr Berezovsky, 65, claims Mr Abramovich \"intimidated\" him into selling shares for a fraction of their true worth. Mr Abramovich denied the claim, and said his former business partner had been key in securing the support of one of the bosses of the companies Sibneft was formed from. Mr Deripaska, 43, said Mr Berezovsky was \"not in a hurry to repay\" and nearly three years later Mr Abramovich agreed to \"take care of the debt\" during a meeting at the Dorchester Hotel in London. Chelsea Football Club has said it made a profit of PS1.4m ($2.2m) for the financial year ending on 30 June, the first time the club has made a profit since Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich took over as owner in 2003. Mr Berezovsky bought the ex-spy - himself in exile in London - a house in Muswell Hill and helped him to publicise claims that Mr Putin organised the bombings of apartment blocks in Russia, in 1999, which paved the way for Russia's second military intervention in Chechnya. In 2012, he lost a PS3bn ($4.7bn) damages claim against Abramovich.. Advertisement The tycoon amassed a fortune in the 1990s following the privatisation of state assets after the collapse of Soviet communism. Last week a UK public inquiry said Mr Putin had \"probably\" approved the murder of ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko. Even before the list was made public, the Kremlin had claimed the US Treasury report was an attempt to meddle in Russia's presidential election. Last November, Russian energy and metals company EN+ raised eyebrows when it listed shares on the London stock exchange. But an unnamed Treasury source tells the Times that the department has a \"very good\" working relationship with the Bank. By Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Bern Swiss cantons have the freedom to fast track foreign residency permits if the applicant is wealthy, and whose taxes could therefore be beneficial to the local community. Meanwhile, the richest person on last year's list, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who founded the Ineos chemicals firm, saw his net worth drop by PS2.9bn since last year, the paper says. A leak of documents - banks' \"suspicious activity reports\" - that have been called the FinCEN Files and seen by BBC Panorama has revealed that Mr Abramovich is behind an offshore company called Leiston Holdings. The UK government is under pressure from MPs to ban two English football clubs from official projects promoting Britain overseas because of their links to two billionaire oligarchs. A group of 24 MPs from six parties have signed a letter sent to the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asking him to ensure neither club fronts or participates in any government trade missions. Written by the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran, and seen by the BBC, it says such work is \"undermined\" if such clubs are involved. \"Football and our football clubs are part of Britain's brand.

There's something captivating about athletes at the very top of their sport, who have practised years for a few minutes in the spotlight, still capable of failing so spectacularly. Their fallibility, in way, is comforting. If even the best are imperfect, it makes our shortcomings that much more tolerable. Nico Lang, writing for Salon.com, has another theory. She thinks viewers, and the media, are enamoured with female figure skating in particular because our culture loves putting women on a pedestal and watching them \"torn apart\". \"Figure skaters are so mesmerizing to American audiences in part because they're consummate athletes whose sport also performs traditional femininity,\" she writes. \"A skater is everything a woman is taught to be, graceful and elegant, an ethereal figure reduced to the very fact of her body. Advertisement In effect, it is the old Madonna/whore trope played out on ice: From \"Revenge\" to the \"Real Housewives\" series, our media culture revels in seeing women torn apart, whether relieved of their hair extensions or exposed for their flaws. A figure skater executing a perfectly graceful routine until the moment she slams into the ice satisfies this obsession perfectly. OK, so maybe Lang's whore metaphor is a bit too subtle. Strip away the sequins, wipe off the pancake makeup, delete the frozen-in-place smiles, and what's left is a tawdry whore of a sport where the judges are the johns. That's Toronto Star columnist Rosie DiManno, in a column complaining that the Canadian team of Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir came in second behind Americans Meryl Davis and Charlie White in the ice dancing competition. She proceeded to analyse the components of the top two finishers, concluding that the Canadians were the victims of a pro-US conspiracy. Some in the American media certainly think so, calling it a \" sore loser attitude \" and labelling DiManno as \" Canada's worst columnist \". The falls, the Byzantine judging process, and the occasional conspiracy theories and nasty spats - it's part of the whole spectacle that surrounds the combination of pure athleticism with art and emotion. Ice skating brings out the best of our media culture - and the worst.

Blurred-out embraces in footage of the EU's Catherine Ashton highlight once again how some media in Iran censor images of women deemed to be inappropriate.

But as well as lifting a crowd, it can also leave you feeling winded and hurt. Monday 13 June: Graziano Pelle, 90+2 minutes. Interestingly Rakuten announced in June that it was closing down its Spanish and UK operations to focus on other European markets - so it'll be interesting to see how it leverages the deal to make sure the sponsorship is money well spent.

Lawyer Konstantin Dobrynin is acting for the film director Alexei Uchitel, whose movie Matilda explores the love of Tsar Nicholas II for a ballerina.

But my parents were both big believers in it. In 2016 it calculated that the richest 62 people in the world had as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population.

BBC News Brazil has spotted a version of the \"microchip\" theory in messages circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook in Portuguese. The message goes on to claim that Bill Gates is finalising plans for a \"stamp-shaped vaccine that goes under the skin\" and that this will be linked to an individual's social media profiles in order to control them via 5G.
