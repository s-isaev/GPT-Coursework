playwright, screenwriter, film producer, actor and TV personality.\n","As part of North Korea's propaganda machine, Jang Jin-sung spent his career writing eulogies of Kim Jong-il, before growing disillusioned and fleeing to South Korea in 2004. But when I met him I felt he was much more individualistic, even a bit selfish - and I was disappointed. After we met, Kim Jong-il asked his aides to take care of me and afterwards I received special treatment - the kind of benefits unavailable to normal citizens. Once you have met him in person, you can't even be prosecuted in court without a special signing off. For privileged, higher class, citizens there are three types of rations - a daily ration, a three day ration and a weekly ration. The daily ration is the highest, I received a weekly ration which was still very lavish. I saw that most people were living an entirely different life from the elite class. I realised North Korea was the poorest country in the world, presided over by the richest king - and that's why I wrote poems that were critical of the regime while I was still there. When I met him the second time it was quite shocking. Things got a bit more complicated and I decided I had to leave. That separation was a sin that I had to commit. One of the first things I noticed was how many trees there were in the mountains. I was also surprised there were so many facilities for disabled people. In North Korea anyone who is disabled is banished outside Pyongyang. More than 20 writers are still needed for an event to include a poet from every nation competing in the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. Writers already confirmed include Jang Jin Seong - former court poet to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il. He fled the regime and now resides in South Korea. Jo Shapcott will represent Great Britain, while Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney will represent Ireland. The event, the UK's largest poetry project, is part of the\n","London 2012 Festival. The week-long event, which runs from 26 June to 1 July, will include readings, talks and performances. The event is inspired by Mount Parnassus in Greece, which was said to have been the home of the Muses - the goddesses of literature, science and the arts in Greek mythology. \"It's not through a lack of effort on our part. \"There's still a certain amount of chaos around it,\" Armitage admitted. We're still waiting to hear about their visas and travel arrangements. You send all the invitations out and you're not sure who's going to turn up. Poetry Parnassus will launch on Tuesday with a\n","Rain of Poems\n","- 100,000 bookmark-shaped verses - dropped from a helicopter over the Southbank Centre's Jubilee Gardens, next to the London Eye. Parnassus poets have contributed to a special anthology, The World Record, to be published on 26 June. Jang Jin-sung left North Korea in 2004 and now runs a news website devoted to reporting events inside the country. \"They seem to really suffer from fear: it resonates in their voices. A report from another trader seemed to confirm this, saying that the execution showed Kim Jong-un's lack of morality and that attitudes towards him had \"turned in a negative direction\".

Psychologists from Edinburgh University and the Medical Research Council in Cambridge reviewed existing research. They say phenomena such as out-of-body experiences or encounters with dead relatives are tricks of the mind rather than a glimpse of the afterlife. The researchers say that many common near-death experiences could be caused by the brain's attempt to make sense of unusual sensations and perceptions occurring during a traumatic event. One of the most frequently reported features of near-death experiences is an awareness of being dead - but the researchers say these feelings are not limited to near-death experiences. But Swiss researchers found such experiences could be artificially induced by stimulating the right temporoparietal junction in the brain that plays a role in perception and awareness. The \"tunnel of light\" sensation reported by those who believe they are having a near-death experience can also be artificially induced. \"While seeming real to those who experience them, near death experiences provide a glimpse of what it is like to die for the rest of us\". Many psychologists think when a person looks up to their right they are likely to be telling a lie and glancing up to the left is said to indicate honesty. However, the experts from\n","Edinburgh University and Hertfordshire University carried out tests\n","and found the theory to be wrong. The research appeared in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE. For this reason, when liars are constructing their own version of the truth, they tend to look to the right. The idea was tested by filming volunteers and recording their eye movements as they told the truth or lied. Carol Brothers can't recall the exact moment she died. Her husband David has much clearer memories of that day three months ago. Carol had had a cardiac arrest - her heart had stopped beating. Luckily, an elderly neighbour knew the rudiments of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and quickly began to work on her chest. \"While 45 minutes is absolutely remarkable and a lot of people would have written her off, we now know there are people who have been brought back, three, four, five hours after they've died and have led remarkably good quality lives,\" says Dr Sam Parnia, the director of resuscitation research at Stony Brook University in New York. He says it is vital that chest compressions occur at the right rate and force and that patients are not over-ventilated. Doctors also have new ways to care for patients after their hearts have been restarted. This is where Carol Brothers was again in luck. After her heart was restarted, she was put on a helicopter where a doctor cooled her down using the frozen food she had just bought at the supermarket. This was yet more luck - Nolan co-wrote best practice guidelines for the UK Resuscitation Council, which he chairs. It looked like she had survived the earthquake but been left devastated by the tsunami. \"Carol was very lucky that she ended up in a hospital with such an eminent expert,\" he says. Hospitals do not declare death, he says, until they have ruled out all processes that can be reversed. The increasingly blurred line between life and death is prompting metaphysical questions as well as medical ones. Ruth Lambert suffered a near-death experience when a fall led to the blood supply to her brain being cut off. \"It was a sense of welcome and going to something better,\" she recalls. Since that time, partly through her work as a senior chaplain at an NHS hospital in London, she has been approached several times with similar accounts. She adds that most religious people see death as a \"final gateway\" and that any evolution of this concept will be very significant for them.\n","Lengtg after cut: 768\n","\n","Mark Gatiss\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 532\n","is an English actor, comedian, screenwriter, director, producer and novelist.\n","Actor Benedict Cumberbatch has admitted he felt an initial rush of anxiety over taking on the role of a modern-day Sherlock Holmes. \"I first heard about this role from Mark while watching the Diamond Jubilee flotilla from the roof of the National Theatre,\" said Bradley, who played the character of Solomon in 2012 episode Dinosaurs on a Spaceship.

It denies killing any Rohingya people, burning their villages, raping women and girls, and stealing possessions. Amnesty International said the army's report was an attempted \"whitewash\". Many who reached Bangladesh - some with bullet or other wounds - said Burmese troops backed by local Buddhist mobs had burned their villages and attacked and killed civilians. The villagers, it said, agreed that security forces: It said \"terrorists\" from within the Rohingya community (which it called Bengali) were responsible for houses being torched, and that the hundreds of thousands of people who fled did so because they were instructed to do so and feared the terrorists. Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent Past investigations into human rights abuses by the Myanmar authorities gave little cause for hope of a fair and thorough inquest this time. The results of this inquiry show little has changed. To no one's surprise, the army has exonerated itself of pretty much all blame. Hundreds arrived in Bangladesh with serious bullet wounds. On a government-organised trip to Rakhine I heard what was clearly heavy machine-gun fire. These are charges the military investigation appears to have chosen to ignore. The general who was in charge of the region has been transferred from his post, but no reason has been given for this move. Major General Maung Maung Soe was \"put in reserve\", a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. Various accolades given to her when she was under house arrest at the orders of the military junta, and seen as the hope for democracy in the country, have now been revoked. Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians. The Rohingya people are predominantly Muslim. They include: The sanctions freezes any of the individuals and entities' assets and bans US citizens from doing business with them. US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said it sent the message that there was \"a steep price to pay for their misdeeds\". Soldiers targeted villagers in a co-ordinated campaign of rape, torture and murder, the rights group alleges. There was no immediate reaction from the military, which denies any abuses. The Amnesty report was published shortly before the UN's special rapporteur on Myanmar said there was no evidence conditions for Rohingya Muslims had improved since August last year, when violence erupted. In its report Amnesty released what it says is detailed evidence of the military's crimes during the brutal crackdown on the Muslim minority. About 700,000 Rohingya have now fled to Bangladesh, where they are living in refugee camps. The Rohingya are one of the many ethnic minorities in Myanmar and make up the largest percentage of Muslims. The government, however, sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship. The rights group accuses the military of sexual violence, torture, forced displacement and burning of markets and farmland to force communities to flee. The list includes army commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and former head of the western command in Rakhine, Maung Maung Soe, who earlier this week was sacked by the military. Myanmar has not ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC and is not bound to co-operate with it. Unlike most countries, the army acts independently of the government. Myanmar has not responded to the Amnesty report but has in the past always maintained the crackdown was a justified response to a specific terrorist threat.

The two Koreas remain technically at war, since no peace treaty was signed after the 1950-53 Korean conflict. Yonhap has close ties to South Korea's government and is publicly funded. The US says it is considering its own sanctions, in addition to any imposed by the UN Security Council, Japan and South Korea. Pyongyang responded on Sunday by calling the threats of \"meaningless sanctions... highly laughable\". The BBC's Korea correspondent Steve Evans says the South is using the same bloodcurdling rhetoric that the North frequently uses about the South Korean government in Seoul. Estimates of the explosive yield of the latest blast have varied. The American team, led by Sung Kim, a former ambassador to South Korea, was due to hold talks with North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui on preparations for the summit, US and South Korean media say. It was the leaders' second meeting in as many months. On Thursday Mr Trump called off the meeting - due in Singapore next month - citing the North's \"hostility\". The aim of the talks is to set an agenda for the summit between the leaders. He is the most senior North Korean to visit the US in nearly 20 years. US President Donald Trump has told reporters he expects Gen Kim to come to Washington DC on Friday and deliver a letter from Kim Jong-un. Former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. \"As the president says, if it happens, we'll certainly be ready,\" she said. But he also said they needed to reduce the gap between them over the extent and pace of nuclear disarmament before the summit could go ahead. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is in Pyongyang for talks with Mr Kim, the first time the North Korean leader has met a senior Russian official. Mr Lavrov also spoke to Mr Pompeo for the first time on Wednesday, by phone. Mr Trump has also downplayed hopes of reaching a quick deal with Mr Kim. In Singapore, where the summit will be held, a US team led by White House official Joe Hagin is thought to be meeting Kim Chang-son, the de facto chief of staff to the North Korean leader, to talk about logistics. He has been described by South Korean and Japanese media as a \"messenger from hell\" due to his hawkish stance on North Korea. Mr Kim was born in Seoul but grew up in Los Angeles. During his time in Washington, he was the special representative for North Korea policy in Washington, director of the Office of Korean Affairs and Staff Assistant in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs. A top aide to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, he has been instrumental in laying the groundwork for the upcoming summits, according to the White House.

The government's strategy for combating alcohol abuse in the armed forces is ineffective, a top psychiatrist says. Prof Neil Greenberg, lead on military health at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said educating personnel about dangers did not stop them from excessive drinking. The Ministry of Defence said it had launched a review of its policy. A 2013 study carried out by the King's Centre for Military Health Research suggested the alcohol consumption of 65% of the 325 personnel sampled was categorised as \"higher risk\". The study also suggested that those with more risky drinking habits were more likely to have mental health problems. Prof Greenberg, who is also a former Surgeon Captain in the Royal Navy, said: \"For many years the military have relied heavily on alcohol education, so for instance soldiers would have to have a brief every year that tells them drinking is bad for them. Serving soldiers told the BBC that after going on an operational tour where alcohol is forbidden, they just want to come back and \"get off their faces\". \"I think one of the first things that needs to be done is to investigate a little more about why it is that people drink heavily in the military,\" he said. He said: \"The drinking culture in the military - literally from when you start - everything you do really is rewarded with alcohol. \"On average on a bad day - where I wasn't really in the mood - it was probably four to five pints a night. But Air Vice Marshal Ray Lock, a retired senior RAF officer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme sometimes there was \"good reason to use alcohol within moderation whilst you're in service\". The Call to Mind: Wales report highlights that while much has been done in recent years, further improvement is required. Progress includes the establishment of the only national veterans' service in the UK. The report was commissioned by the Forces in Mind Trust and forms part of a wider review. The aim is to find the most effective ways to assess the mental and related health needs of veterans, to support the development of those services, and ensure valuable resources are spent wisely. Ray Lock, chief executive of Forces in Mind Trust, said serving men and women deserve consistent and effective support. Military veterans will be guaranteed interviews for some government jobs as part of a pilot scheme to boost their employment prospects. The initiative, launched by the Office for Veterans' Affairs (OVA) in the Cabinet Office, will start in the spring within certain departments. Previous studies have shown ex-servicemen and women face many barriers to civilian employment. He said: \"Negative stereotypes can prevent ex-service personnel accessing the same employment opportunities as their civilian counterparts.

Mr Panetta is in Delhi to discuss the new US strategic focus on Asia. Her maid had complained the diplomat was paying her less than the minimum stipulated wages under US visa requirements. \"I think the most important, immediate concern is to ensure that no further indignity is inflicted upon the young officer. Security barricades around the US embassy in Delhi were removed and a visiting US delegation was snubbed. Ms Khobragade's arrest has escalated into a huge diplomatic row between India and the US with Delhi saying it was \"shocked and appalled\" at the manner in which the diplomat was \"humiliated\" in the US. If found guilty, she faces a maximum sentence of 10 years for visa fraud and five years for making false statements. The US state department said that Ms Khobragade did not have full diplomatic immunity. It said under the UN's Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, she is immune from arrest only for crimes committed in connection with her work. Rather than deepening relations, the two countries are deep into a lengthy period of crisis management. This is the third case of alleged mistreatment by Indian diplomats in New York in three years. New Delhi has retaliated by taking away privileges accorded US diplomats in India and removing security barriers guarding the American embassy there. But the arrest of a diplomat is never just another case. If the state department did not know she would be strip-searched, it should have - and should have demanded special handling. India is a rising power the United States has been cultivating for years. Indian diplomats surely understand that disrespecting US law and international norms undermine its emergence as a constructive global actor. He said the \"unfortunate\" incident should not damage US-Indian relations. Ms Khobragade appeared in a Manhattan court last Friday and was freed on bail. \"It is true that she was fully searched by a female Deputy Marshal - in a private setting - when she was brought into the US Marshals' custody, but this is standard practice for every defendant, rich or poor, American or not,\" he said. Earlier, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described Ms Khobragade's treatment as \"deplorable\". \"In terms of giving a strong, unambiguous, direct message to the United States of America: whatever I believe we were supposed to do, we did immediately,\" Mr Khursheed told the Indian parliament. On Wednesday, Mr Kerry spoke to Indian National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon, who had described the treatment as \"despicable and barbaric\". On Wednesday, angry MPs from several Indian parties called on the government to take tough action against the US and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described Ms Khobragade's treatment as \"deplorable\". According to documents filed in a federal court in New York, Ms Khobragade wrote on a visa application that the maid would be paid $4,500 (PS2,746) a month. Border patrols have often bumped into each other, resulting in occasional scuffles. India claims China already occupies 38,000sq km (about 14,700sq miles) of its territory. This is a worrying sign because it's different from Chinese behaviour in the past,\" Mr Menon told interviewer Karan Thapar in The Wire, an independent online news portal. In a tactical sense, Delhi's beefing up of the border infrastructure may have triggered the Chinese army into action in Ladakh. On Tuesday evening, India said the troops had disengaged from the clash site. Indian students have flocked to Chinese universities.

In 2012, Chivukuvuku left UNITA and founded the Broad Convergence for the Salvation of Angola electoral alliance, which became one of the main contenders in the 2012 legislative election, winning 6% of the votes.\n","Conditions do not exist in Angola for a free and fair vote in polls on Friday, the main opposition party has said. Analysts say the governing ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) is expected to win an easy victory. The failure to publish a full electoral list - despite a legal requirement - has created confusion about where people should vote and the lack of transparency has prompted allegations that the vote is being fixed in the government's favour, she says. Unita's leader, Isaias Samakuva, has said he wants to meet Mr dos Santos to discuss the various problems, the AFP news agency reports. \"We are very concerned,\" Unita spokesman Alcides Sakala told the BBC. The MPLA is campaigning on a ticket of continuity under a slogan of \"Grow more, distribute better\" - a direct response to criticism that the country's vast oil wealth has stayed in the hands of a small elite. We organised free and fair elections in 2008 so now we will show the world we can do it again,\" party activist Vieira Lopes, 45, told the BBC. However, the party faces stiff competition from a new party, Casa, formed in March by charismatic former Unita politician Abel Chivukuvuku, who is also vying for the youth vote and promoting an anti-corruption agenda, she says. Voting has been reported as smooth and orderly, despite fears of irregularities. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 70, is expected to win another five-year term - he has been in power since 1979. The polls are the first held under a new constitution that abolished direct presidential elections. She says the voting seemed to have been taken place in an orderly fashion. Angelo Kapwacha, from the Civil Society Electoral Process Reflection, a group of non-politically aligned national observers, said the country was not ready for the vote. \"I don't have any water or electricity in my home,\" explained Andre Antonio, a motorbike courier, as he parked a bike - his only source of livelihood - on the crumbling litter-strewn pavement. \"We need the basics like water and power. Waiting for a cold drink at a roadside stand, Severino Augusto, said: \"I can't really comment on how the election was organised. The MPLA is the biggest party so it makes sense it would win. \"But for me what is important is that they start working for the people. \"They promised all young people somewhere to live but I am still waiting,\" the 22 year old sighed. \"They have built lots of new houses but many are standing empty. While polling day ran significantly more smoothly than in 2008, when voting spilled over into a second day, there were some problems. Registered voters could not find themselves on lists or were told they were supposed to be voting hundreds of kilometres away. It has been more than a decade since peace came to the country and people, especially the young who have no memory of war, now want to start sharing in its dividends. Mr Dos Santos is not contesting the poll, but his party the MPLA is expected to be victorious when the results are announced later this week. The presidency would then pass to former Defence Minister Joao Lourenco. It is led by Abel Chivukuvuku, who split from Unita. It is not clear if they are still in custody or the exact nature of their charges. Critics of the government say rampant corruption means the country's oil wealth did not spread beyond the ruling elite. After the war, Angola was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world because of its huge oil reserves. Although Mr Dos Santos is standing down as president, a position he has held since 1979, his children also hold several key positions.\n","Lengtg after cut: 881\n","\n","Carolyn Wilson\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 639\n","is a British former synchronized swimmer.\n","Measures aimed at giving men and women equal pay at a council could lead to some staff seeing reductions in their wages, a union has warned.

The move has resulted in the Independents, who form the largest group on the council, being frozen out of power for the first time. The Independent group on Highland Council and the authority's new administration have clashed over appointments to outside bodies. Council leader Drew Hendry said it was \"sour grapes\" and there were committees dominated by Independents. Ms Wilson said the political parties were \"ganging up\" on the Independents. He said some outside bodies and committees were dominated by Independents, while others were not. The Independent group has had a series of clashes with the administration since May's elections. She said independent councillors were at first offered just one place on the working group. Independent councillors and members of the SNP, Labour and Liberal Democrat administration have previously clashed on the make up of committees and outside bodies. Ms Wilson said that after \"much huddling and conferring\" a second place in the welfare reform working group was given to an independent councillor. But she said the handling of the situation \"represented another sign of the dictatorship that is now Highland Council\". Efforts are being made to roll out faster broadband across the Highlands and Islands. The council's Independent Group leader Carolyn Wilson accused the SNP-led ruling administration of acting \"like a dictatorship\" after independent councillors were at first offered just one place on the group. Ms Wilson has declined to comment on the administration's demand. The row has broken out following a meeting of the local authority's finance committee. Independent councillors Laurie Fraser and Donnie Mackay wanted a vote on a proposal to raise rents by 2% and lodged a motion for it to be capped. Ms Wilson declined to comment on the matter. The SNP, which leads the administration, described her claims as \"preposterous\". It also said that almost a third of customers wanted to be able to access services online. Highland Council has committed to funding a four-year programme of improvements to 165 monuments. The council said it understood there was some \"frustration\" but its aim was to complete the work by 2018. Mr Mackenzie said in cases where no funding was sought for repairs the memorial would be improved by the local authority.

The Scottish Law Commission said the law must be updated to take account of modern technology and ensure consumers and businesses are fully protected. The current law is based on traditional oral and paper contracts. But the commission has asked how they can be formed online, and whether electronic signatures are valid. It has launched a discussion paper to discover if the law should be updated. Few people realise they are entering into contracts every day, whether they are buying a bus ticket or a loaf of bread. But this review has been prompted by the rapid growth of electronic contracts, for example downloading a ringtone or music or purchasing books or clothes from an online retailer. The lead commissioner, Prof Hector MacQueen, said: \"With the rise in new technology it is high time that our law on how contracts are formed is reviewed and updated. \"Our proposals would lead to a clear and modern law in line with developments in technology and its usage. Responses to the discussion document should be received by 29 June. The body has launched a consultation on proposed changes to the law. It wants to make contracts simpler and clearer. The commission said competition for customers, fuelled by developments such as price comparison websites, meant some traders were burying the true cost of a contract in the small print. The consultation is being carried out jointly by the Scottish Law Commission and the Law Commission, which covers England and Wales. Both bodies made recommendations for reform in 2005, which were accepted in principle but were never implemented. Each year consumers sign up to a variety of contracts for things such as mobile phones, gym memberships and household utilities. The commission wants to reduce the liability for unexpected charges. Scottish Law Commissioner, Prof Hector MacQueen, said: \"We are proposing a new approach to unfair terms which would assist consumers and traders alike. \"First, it would protect consumers from being caught out by unpleasant surprises such as unexpected charges. The commission wants to hear the views of consumers and traders. Consumers need more protection against hidden charges often tucked away in the small print, according to two bodies responsible for promoting law reform. The Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission say in a report published on Tuesday that courts should be empowered to scrutinise the fairness of prices. Regulators can already investigate cases of alleged market abuse by firms such as airlines, gyms or banks. But the commissions said the law which underpins investigations needs reform. The commissions recommend that courts should not interfere with prices which are \"transparent and prominent\" - but when charges are hidden in small print, they should be given the power to assess them for fairness. The commissions say that the rise of price-comparison websites have put pressure on traders to advertise low headline prices, while playing down other hidden charges. They say small print is not \"just about font size\", but also includes poor layout, densely phrased paragraphs and legal jargon. The commissions conclude that the current law is \"unacceptably uncertain\", which risks damaging businesses as well as consumers. Other recommendations from the commissions include more powers to remove legal jargon from the contracts entered by consumers when they purchase computer software, designed to limit the product's use. These so-called end user licence agreements (EULAs) should be expressed in \"plain, intelligible language\", they say.\n","Lengtg after cut: 702\n","\n","Dhruv Narayan Singh\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 606\n","is an Indian politician active in Madhya Pradesh State of India.\n","Police in India have raided the offices of a legislator in Madhya Pradesh state in connection with the murder of a right-to-information activist last year in the city of Bhopal. Bharatiya Janata Party's Dhruv Narayan Singh was also questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Last week, police arrested two people, including an architect in Bhopal, Zahida Parvez. The second person was a criminal hired for the killing, they said. Shehla Masood was found with a gunshot wound in her car outside her home on 16 August. She was on her way to an anti-corruption protest in the city. A special team of senior CBI investigators is arriving in Bhopal on Monday to investigate the murder. Mr Singh's office was searched on Sunday evening and he was questioned for several hours on Saturday. \"The CBI had called me for questioning and I have told them whatever information I had on the issue. Whenever the agency would call me again, I will go there,\" Mr Singh told reporters after he was questioned. Officials have not said anything yet about the motive behind the killing. But media reports, quoting CBI sources, said Mr Singh was close to both Ms Masood and Ms Parvez. Ms Masood, who ran an event management company, had filed a number of right-to-information applications, a number of them related to wildlife conservation. According to reports, last year she had informed the authorities that she \"feared for her life\" and had complained about it to the police chief. Nearly a dozen right-to-information activists have been killed and many others attacked in India since 2008. The law allows Indians to access information held by the government. Police in India have charged five people in connection with the murder of right-to-information activist Shehla Masood last year in the city of Bhopal. City-based architect Zahida Pervez is amongst those who have been charged with murder and conspiracy. A local politician who was earlier questioned in connection with the murder has not been charged. Ms Masood was found with a gunshot wound in her car outside her home on 16 August. She was on her way to an anti-corruption protest in the city. On Friday, the Central Bureau of Investigation charged Zahida Parvez with conspiracy to murder. Four others - including Zahida's colleague Saba Farooqui, Shakib, Irfan and Tabish - have been charged with destruction of evidence.

It was a very deliberate contrast to their last awkward, tetchy meeting, when Benjamin Netanyahu lectured Barack Obama on Israeli and Jewish history. The two men may not have warm feelings towards each other, but they don't want the embarrassment of a public falling out. President Obama, again stressing that he \"has Israel's back\", is well aware of the damage a public spat with Israel could do in an election year. Mr Netanyahu does not face an election, but there are those at home who don't like his feuding with the US president. So there was plenty of talk of agreement. The trouble was they stressed different points of agreement. President Obama repeated that it was \"unacceptable\" for Iran to get nuclear weapons, and that he meant it when he said \"all options\" were on the table. \"I know that both the prime minister and I prefer to resolve this diplomatically,\" Mr Obama said. \"We understand the costs of any military action. The Israeli prime minister, hands splayed on his knees, listened intently, nodding from time to time. For him, the key point was the president's acceptance of Israel's sovereign right to act on its own. \"Israel must have the ability always to defend itself by itself against any threat; and that when it comes to Israel's security, Israel has the right, the sovereign right to make its own decisions,\" Mr Netanyahu said. \"And after all, that's the very purpose of the Jewish state - to restore to the Jewish people control over our destiny. And that's why my supreme responsibility as prime minister of Israel is to ensure that Israel remains the master of its fate,\" he added. It was time for the president to nod in agreement. Both men know that a lack of unity can only benefit a common enemy. But the disagreement between them is profound. In one sense, it boils down to their different red lines - what they will not allow. President Obama has said Iran must be stopped from \"possessing\" a nuclear weapon. That probably would not happen for a couple of years. The Israeli government's red line is apparently when Iran has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb (and when they hide it deep underground). Analysts say the Iranians could achieve that later this year. One Israeli journalist has written that the plan is to drag the US into a war just before the presidential elections in November. But this is not just about when to go to war. President Obama has stressed his reluctance to go to war at all. The US military feels this even more strongly. President Barack Obama has briefed congressional leaders on his plans for an expanded military campaign against Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq and Syria, and will address the American people about those plans on Wednesday. Former commander of US Central Command Gen Anthony Zinni tells the BBC's Katty Kay he hopes to hear on Wednesday the US will build a coalition of regional partners in the fight against IS but he is not confident the US has led on this issue.

Network Rail said the work was essential and it would be unsafe to keep the crossing open. The level crossing is due to reopen on 13 February. Network Rail's contractor, Amey Rail, has also been criticised by traders who were given less than 10 days notice about the closure. Carol Palmer-Ley from Scoffs Fish and Chips received a letter from Amey about the closure on Thursday. \"It's health and safety, so there's nothing to be done, but to be told only two days before I think is pretty bad,\" she said.

George Theurer, chairman of the wig suppliers group at the UK's Hairdressing and Beauty Suppliers Association (HBSA), said: \"Labour costs are much lower in China, the quality of what they produce is excellent and cheaper than what we can produce. Of the 25 wig suppliers in the HBSA most now concentrate almost entirely on supplying wigs made overseas. Only two still produce wigs from scratch. One of those companies is Oxfordshire-based Banbury Postiche which has been producing wigs since 1914. It also imports many more ready-made acrylic wigs now and sells materials to buyers ranging from other wig-makers around the world to film productions. We don't use particularly modern techniques,\" she said. Mrs Palmer agreed that it has had \"no effect whatsoever\". Instead, one of the most significant threats to wig-making at Raoul and Banbury Postiche is a lack of future talent. \"Alan's retiring next year - we can't replace someone of his experience overnight. We are unique and if we lose that skill set, it leaves a big hole. Mr Theurer, who has been in the industry for over 60 years, echoed their concerns and said he believed the cost of labour in this country meant that was unlikely to change. \"The cost of making them here is not supportable,\" he said. Mr Theurer, co-director at A&A Studios in Scotland, remains \"very optimistic\" about the future of wig suppliers in England, if not wig-making.

Its teenage interviewees - post-war baby boomers who had grown up in a landscape of increasing wealth and materialism - spoke candidly about their distrust of politicians, their discovery of the birth control pill and their fear of a third world war. Nowadays, the term Generation X is more associated with the title of the 1991 novel by Canadian writer Douglas Coupland, which kick-started a label for a new trend of counter-cultural drifting twentysomethings.

But the analysis showed 137 out of 152 hospital trusts have been above that level since the start of December. Richard Taylor, 55, from Liverpool, says he was left devastated after watching the \"undignified\" death of his mum Sheila in January. She was taken to Aintree Hospital but spent 13 hours on a trolley waiting for a bed before being admitted. If she was an animal, they would have put her down - she was starving and dehydrated. The findings have been highlighted as the BBC launches a special week of coverage about the state of the NHS. It comes as the government in England has announced that from April this year foreign patients could be refused operations unless they cover their costs. Hospitals will be expected to check upfront whether an individual is eligible for free non-urgent care by asking for ID. The 85% occupancy mark is an internationally recognised level that hospitals are advised to stick to in order to help them manage the risk of infections and to enable them to have the spare capacity to deal with major on-the-day emergencies. Mr Hopson said: \"Above 85% and the risks start rising and once you get into the 90% it is significant. \"It started from Boxing Day onwards,\" he said. A spokesman for NHS England acknowledged the situation was impacting on the way hospitals were performing. Without that support being provided - either from council care teams or district nursing - these patients cannot be discharged. None of the other UK nations could provide the BBC with bed occupancy data this winter. Southend Hospital in Essex said it has \"no intention... to support the pilot at this time\". The trial by healthcare start-up CareRooms involves 30 hospital patients staying in local residents' spare rooms while waiting to be discharged. It had been criticised by politicians and health groups as a \"ridiculous\" idea. Earlier, CareRooms said it would recruit \"hosts\" whose properties had spare rooms or annexes with a private bathroom to create \"secure care spaces for patients who are waiting to be discharged\". The idea of NHS hospital patients recuperating in Airbnb-style accommodation has not been ruled out, health minister Philip Dunne has said. Southend Hospital had been linked to a trial where hospital patients could be discharged to people's spare rooms. The hospital distanced itself from the idea following criticism by politicians and health groups. The idea followed warnings about delays in discharges from UK hospitals. \"This is not national policy, anything innovative needs to be very carefully scrutinised and assessed before we proceed with it. It could also include B&B owners who were already medically trained and could offer accommodation, he said. The idea first emerged last week, when it sparked widespread debate. Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said the scheme would be a \"sticking plaster\" for wider NHS issues, while shadow social care minister Barbara Keeley warned there were \"clear safety risks\".

In October, Mr Trump told US TV network CBS that he and Mr Putin would \"probably get along... very well\". But it was clear Vladimir Putin, 67, had change in mind.

The offence, under the Criminal Justice Act 1987, carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and an unlimited fine. Mr Westfield was released by Essex County Cricket Club this season. The scam took place in a match between Durham and Essex in September 2009. Mr Milliken-Smith told the court that despite these rumours at Essex County Cricket Club, a \"blind eye\" was turned, and opportunities to report the allegations were initially missed.

According to the UN, an estimated 300,000 people have been killed in Darfur and more than 2.6 million displaced since ethnic rebels took up arms in 2003. A government minister and pro-government militia leader have also been indicted for alleged war crimes in Darfur. Two Sudan rebel leaders have appeared at the International Criminal Court to face war crimes charges over an attack on peacekeepers in Darfur. Abdallah Banda Abakaer Nourain and Saleh Mohammed Jerbo Jamus surrendered to The Hague on Wednesday after being secretly indicted last year. Twelve African Union peacekeepers died in the 2007 attack in Haskanita. The men called for other ICC indictees, such as Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, to hand themselves over. Last year, the court issued an arrest warrant for President Bashir, accusing him of war crimes in Darfur. A Sudanese government minister and pro-government militia leader have also been indicted. The next hearing in the case against the two rebel leaders was set for November. In February, charges against another rebel leader to do with the same incident were dropped. ICC judges ruled prosecutors could not prove that Bahr Idriss Abu Garda, who also gave himself up voluntarily, had planned the attack on the Haskanita AU camp in September 2007. \"I came here voluntarily in response to the summons of the ICC and I call upon everyone who has been summoned by this court to come here to exonerate themselves,\" AFP news agency quotes Mr Banda as telling a panel of three judges. The two have been charged with: \"It is alleged that the attackers, numbering approximately 1,000, were armed with anti-aircraft guns, artillery guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers,\" said an ICC statement. After the charges were read out, the men, who described themselves as \"revolutionaries\", were told they were free to go. The November hearing will decide whether there is enough evidence to bring the case to trial. In January 2008, the UN took joint control of the peacekeeping force in Darfur with increased numbers and a stronger mandate. Mr Bashir's indictment was the first issued by the ICC against a sitting president.

In the US, a Newsweek survey in 2005 put the figure at a quarter. \"People associate religious institutions with constraining doctrines, and bad things that are done in the world.

Walter Ellis, formerly a journalist and foreign correspondent for several British and Irish newspapers, now writes obituaries for The Times of London.\n","Journalist David McKittrick remembers Andrew Boyd, the journalist, lecturer and historian who died on Tuesday. Andrew Boyd was a prolific journalist and popular historian who for decades enlivened the Belfast writing scene with his trenchant opinions and researches into the city's history and politics. From that standpoint he was outspokenly critical of practically all political groupings, left, right and centre. His most striking work was his book Holy War in Belfast, which detailed the violent outbreaks other historians had tended to play down. By an extraordinary coincidence his account of the city's previous violent episodes was published in August 1969, the exact month when the most recent troubles erupted. Rarely has there been a more timely example of history repeating itself. Until its publication few if any were aware of the recurring pattern of communal commotion in Belfast. Previous histories, he wrote, were characterised by \"blandness\" with the sectarian riots barely mentioned. Mountainous amounts of material were available in the form of reports of various official commissions of inquiry which gave an almost literally blow-by-blow account of rioting. Boyd burrowed into the dusty volumes of evidence and conclusions, which generally blamed loyalists and police. A unionist historian later wrote disapprovingly that his book was \"vividly written, but exhibits strong political prejudices\". Boyd, who was born in 1921, was the son of a Boer War veteran. From an early age he disavowed traditional unionist politics. He married Kathleen Kelly, a Catholic from the Falls Road, the couple returning to Belfast in the early 1950s. At various times he had connections, formal or informal, with the civil rights movement, the SDLP, the Communist party and other groupings. He also had influential contacts in the British and Irish labour parties. His articles appeared in publications such as the Irish News, Irish Times, New Statesman, Economist, Tribune and Daily Worker. He disapproved of the Good Friday Agreement. In retirement he applied himself to new challenges, setting himself the task of reading Flaubert, Zola and De Maupassant in the original French. He had an abiding love of literature and was a keen mathematician, delighting his grandchildren with mathematical puzzles and conundrums. His longevity meant he outlived all his closest friends, but until a few months before his death he was corresponding with academics on his life and work. In his final years he retained his brand of independence, sceptical and nonconformist to the last, ever unafraid of appearing out of step with prevailing orthodoxies.

Alan Scott, 38, killed his mother Stella, 63, and father Alan, 61, in Allerton in April 2008. His family claimed flaws in Mr Scott's care led to the killings. Mr Scott was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after pleading guilty to manslaughter later that year. Mr Rebello said there were deficiencies in care but these did not have a \"direct causal link\" to the deaths. Scott also missed appointments at Moss House community mental health facility in Garston. He had been sectioned twice under the Mental Health Act and had, the court heard, suffered delusional episodes about his parents in which he thought they were trying to harm him. Eight days before the killings, Scott had called at Moss House to get an injection but there was no staff member available to administer it. A psychiatric nurse later called at his home to give him the injection, but there was no answer. His sisters Colette McCormack, 42, and Christine Scott, 41, demanded a full inquest after learning their parents' deaths were the fourth in a pattern of similar incidents involving the NHS in the Merseyside area. The first minister told Holyrood she was bringing forward the reopening of the facilities, which were previously expected to open in mid-September. Younger children will be able to take part in all activity. The move has been widely welcomed by the sports and fitness industry which had become increasingly vocal in its calls to allow gyms and pools to reopen safely. Scottish Swimming said it had shared guidance on safely reopening with pool operators but warned not all of them were likely to reopen on 31 August. Anytime Fitness, which runs gyms across the UK, said it was delighted but would only allow its Scottish gyms to reopen when they were \"fully compliant\" with government guidelines. And gym owner Steven McLaughlin told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime that Ms Sturgeon's announcement was a \"surprise but certainly a welcome one\". He said they hoped to learn from the gym reopening process in England and they were ready to welcome members back to the studio. \"That team that we've got can finally all come back together again and we can welcome that family of members,\" he said. In a statement ahead of First Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon said more restrictions were due be lifted on 14 September. They would see sports stadiums, theatres and live music venues reopened with social distancing, limits on capacity and enhanced hygiene. Indoor contact sports for people aged 12 and over could also return. \"However, I must stress these possible changes are at this stage indicative only,\" Ms Sturgeon said. Ms Sturgeon also announced that police would be given powers to break up and disperse house parties. \"This is the highest number of daily cases in three months,\" she said. Twenty-seven of those positive tests can be linked to an outbreak in Coupar Angus, and there were 12 new cases in Grampian, where Aberdeen remains in lockdown. For Scotland to move into phase four, she said ministers would have to be satisfied that \"the virus is no longer considered a significant threat to public health\". The first minister added that the government was not setting a date for the reopening of non-essential call centres and offices. A full return to office working would significantly increase the risk of transmission, she warned. \"For now, working from home remains the default position,\" she said.

The forest, in southern Sri Lanka, is a World Heritage Site and home to species such as the badger mongoose and purple-faced leaf monkey. Officials said they would conduct an on-the-ground report. It is unclear how long the suspension will last. And there seems to be uncertainty about how close the road would go to the area protected by Unesco. Campaigners say it will result in widespread forest clearance close by, going against international recommendations that the reserve be expanded. An environmental lawyer told the BBC that the government failed to make an environmental impact assessment on the road project - required because it would pass within 100m of the protected area.

Sri Lanka is to investigate the role of the media in the death of a Buddhist monk on Saturday, the day after he set fire to himself. Officials say journalists who filmed Bowatte Indarathana's self-immolation could have tried to have him rescued.

Meanwhile, hardline Buddhist nationalists are hailing the dead monk as a hero for his act.

Venerable Indarathana was protesting against the slaughter of cattle and the alleged conversion of Buddhists by Sri Lanka's minority faiths. He set himself on fire outside the holiest Buddhist shrine in the country - the Temple of the Tooth in the central city of Kandy. He died in intensive care in the capital Colombo the following day. The monk - believed to be aged 30 - belonged to a Buddhist revivalist group which has been campaigning against the Muslim halal method of slaughtering animals. The government condemned media outlets showing video of the incident. The BBC's correspondent in Sri Lanka, Charles Haviland, says some viewers have criticised the extensive coverage the suicide received from a hardline Buddhist TV channel, Swarnavahini. However, Sinhalese ultra-nationalist ministers in the government have praised the incident as an act of self-sacrifice for the good of the country, he adds.

German transport minister Andreas Scheuer said the ministry and Daimler had \"negotiated intensively for many hours\" on Monday. Afterwards he said the ministry had ordered the \"immediate\" recall of Daimler models in Germany because they contained \"illegal shutdown devices\".

Journalist Wilf Mbanga believes some the symptoms of hubris syndrome apply to Robert Mugabe. Mbanga once knew Mugabe so well they would listen to Jim Reeves tracks together. But hubris, or sheer ambition, drives many to stay on for as long as they can. And the advantages of incumbency mean many will manage to do so - even into their dotage. Constitutional term limits don't always work but for those who want to restrain power hungry leaders, they are perhaps the most effective tool available. More than 600 people have been killed by security forces since the coup began. But while the West, most notably the US, has been keen to take the lead in imposing sanctions, Myanmar's biggest trade partners in Asia have rejected that approach. \"The leverage is not really there,\" said Richard Horsey, a Myanmar expert with the International Crisis Group. But ETC denies those funds could have been used to commit human rights abuses, saying that under Myanmar law, the Quartermaster General must turn over all funds to the government's budget account. Activists might cause headaches for ETC, but the company can't be in breach of sanctions because Singapore hasn't imposed any. Their track record in Myanmar - which was not part of the PIIE study - is hotly debated. Gary Hufbauer, who led the PIIE's research, said sanctions tend to have a higher chance of success against poor countries like Myanmar. It's everywhere in the extractive sector,\" she said.

The selection of a Supreme Court justice gives a president the opportunity to influence US public life for decades, as the justices are not bound by term limits. Ms Kagan, a native of New York, is unlikely to alter the court's narrowly divided ideological make-up. All three days of the Supreme Court hearing are box office sell-outs. Inside, Solicitor General Donald Verilli, arguing for the Obama administration in opposing the law, clarified that the federal government's case rests not on arguments about racial profiling or civil rights but on the fundamental legal principle that the federal government alone looks after immigration. For nearly two hours on Wednesday, the nine justices in Washington DC grilled lawyers on the constitutionality of Doma, with five of them making sceptical remarks about the 1996 law. The US Supreme Court has ruled police may routinely take DNA cheek swabs from suspects who have been arrested but not yet convicted of a crime. Justice Scalia's death comes just 11 months before the end of Mr Obama's term as president, so Republicans in the Senate are going to be under intense pressure from some conservatives to do everything they can to delay confirmation of a replacement until a new chief executive is sworn in on 20 January 2017. Judge Garland said in a video released by the White House that the experience investigating and prosecuting Timothy McVeigh, who was later put to death for the attack, was one of the most formative experiences in his legal career. In other words, federal immigration law may have been on Mr Trump's side, but the Constitution wasn't. Mr Trump said on Wednesday that speed was necessary in implementing the ban because otherwise a \"whole pile of bad people, perhaps with very evil intentions\" would enter the country before border restrictions tightened. In December, the court ruled it could go into full effect even as legal challenges continued in lower courts. US President Donald Trump has hailed a Supreme Court ruling upholding his travel ban which covers people from several Muslim-majority countries. Justices at times appeared to be searching for a clean way to define when such efforts endanger the democratic process. Ruth Bader Ginsburg seemed to suggest the White House had not adequately weighed the impact of its decision to end the programme, noting, \"they said it was illegal and said nothing about the policy\". \"She's trying really hard to demystify the court, showing 'You can be a justice too',\" Lithwick says. Breyer, the king of the complicated hypothetical, has sought to \"bridge gaps\" in differences between the justices, Coyle says, by listening closely to find give-and-take between justices on an issue.

Canadian company TransCanada is seeking permission to build the 1,600-mile (2,700km) Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to the Gulf coast in Texas. TransCanada said the protesters were ignoring the jobs the pipeline would create. The decision as to whether to allow the project is fraught with political risk for Mr Obama, reports the BBC's Zoe Conway in Washington. If he rejects it, he could be accused of destroying jobs. The crude oil pipeline would run from western Canada to oil refineries on the Texas coast. The Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, criticised the Obama administration for failing to give the green light to a project that would have created \"hundreds of thousands of jobs\". \"The president's policies are making the economy worse, not better,\" he said, adding that the pipeline would be good for the country. The legislature of Nebraska passed a measure requiring state approval of any route before TransCanada could start construction. The US state department, however, said this would not be enough time to carry out the legally required environmental studies needed to approve the project. Global emissions of carbon dioxide may be showing the first signs of a \"permanent slowdown\" in the rate of increase. Emissions from China increased by 3% but this was a significant slowdown compared to annual increases of around 10% over the past decade. The first was the ending of a large economic stimulus package. The 2014 prize was awarded to Mr Snowden for \"his courage and skill in revealing the unprecedented extent of state surveillance violating basic democratic processes and constitutional rights\". There has been widespread international condemnation of the US move. The US issued its formal notification on the first day it was possible to do so. For Russia, which ratified the deal last month after a long delay, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was very hard to talk about a climate agreement without the US. US Democrats and environmentalists condemned the decision. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, condemned Mr Trump's move as a \"disastrous decision that sells out our children's future\", while former vice-president and climate campaigner Al Gore derided those who would \"sacrifice the planet for their greed\". He has also suggested that the Paris Agreement gives China and other big polluters an unfair advantage over the US by allowing them to continue to increase emissions. Reports suggest the Trump administration has made no effort to renegotiate the Paris agreement. The country's economy, security and society depend on them. \"It is one of his top priorities, without any question whatsoever,\" Mr Kerry assured me. Mr Kerry was President Barack Obama's secretary of state and a key architect of the Paris climate change summit in 2015. \"He is mobilising every department, every agency of the United States government to focus on climate and he is determined to try and restore America's credibility and reputation,\" explained Kerry. The president wants to send \"a decisive signal about the end of one epoch and the beginning of another,\" says Mr McKibben. Share prices plunged, and Goldman Sachs warned of a drop in US crude supplies. But, at the same time, President Biden has reiterated his desire to end all fossil fuel subsidies, ordered a ban on new oil and gas leases on federal land, and said a third of all federal lands must be reserved for conservation. The key, says Mr Kerry, is \"a massive shift\" in attitudes in the private sector. US car makers are coming to accept that fuel economy standards have to rise, for example.

Mr Mahathir said he was \"embarrassed\" to be associated with the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) because of its support for current PM Najib Razak. Mr Najib denies the allegations and has been officially cleared. Mr Najib was accused of taking $681m (PS479m) from a state investment fund into his personal bank account. \"I feel embarrassed that I am associated with a party that is seen as supporting corruption - it had caused me to feel ashamed. But he said he would not be setting up a new party. Analysis: Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia Correspondent This isn't the first time the colourful and outspoken Mr Mahathir has resigned from his party - but at the age of 90 it will probably be his last. Until recently he could count on strong support within Umno, the party which has governed Malaysia since independence. But its reach extends well beyond the UK and US, with its website boasting of supporting more than 100 campaigns across five continents. The UK-based company, which denies any wrongdoing, has an extensive record of work abroad. Cambridge Analytica's website also says it was involved in political campaigning in Italy in 2012, on behalf of a \"resurgent political party last successful in the 1980s\". But the role of SCL goes back much further. It claims to have helped the Orange Revolution in 2004 in Ukraine which helped bring the pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko to power. \"SCL succeeded in maintaining the cohesion of the coalition to ensure a hard-fought victory,\" an old post on the SCL website reads. More recently, SCL says it was hired by the Ukrainian government to provide \"localised communications campaigns\" to help them win back control of Donetsk during the conflict in eastern Ukraine. \"The final project report was delivered to the President of Ukraine... this report was pivotal in later national decisions,\" the company says. But Mr Turnbull told Channel 4 their input actually went much further. \"We have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging. I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing - so just about every element of this candidate,\" he said. But the country's main opposition coalition - the National Super Alliance (Nasa) - has called for a full investigation to be carried out. The UK's Guardian newspaper says that Cambridge Analytica was hired by a Nigerian billionaire who was \"panicking at the idea of a change of government\" to work on then-president Goodluck Jonathan's re-election campaign. The newspaper said sources familiar with the campaign described how the company was looking to collect \"kompromat\" - compromising material or information - on opposition leader Muhammadu Buhari. SCL Elections, Cambridge Analytica's parent company, has denied receiving or using hacked or stolen information. In July 2017, Cambridge Analytica revealed that it had teamed up with a phone app in Mexico and Colombia called Pig. The firm was hoping to use data mined from Pig. The post sought people \"with significant political experience\" who were interested in becoming a campaign manager in one of eight Mexican states, Buzzfeed reported. He names among them the 2014 general election which swept Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power. However both parties have denied any links with the company. In the Channel 4 investigation, Malaysia was named as one of the countries in which Cambridge Analytica had operated, sparking a huge national debate ahead of a general election.

Earlier this month a woman was gang-raped in a minivan in Jakarta late at night. Instead of giving heavy punishment to the rapists, the governor blamed it on women's dress. This is discrimination,\" protest co-ordinator Chika Noya told AFP news agency. There have been more than 100,000 cases of violence against women so far this year in Indonesia, 4% of which were rape cases, according to the country's National Commission for Women's Affairs. Unofficial results from quick counts in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, indicate that Joko Widodo has won a lead in elections for a new governor. The mayor of Solo, Central Java, leads over incumbent Fauzi Bowo in polls seen as a key indicator of how the public may vote in the 2014 general polls. Almost seven million voters registered in what correspondents say was a hotly-contested election. The official results will be announced on 1 October. Most of Indonesia's opposition parties backed Mr Widodo, who is also commonly known as Jokowi. Mr Bowo was the central government's candidate. At least two quick count results showed Mr Widodo leading with 54% of the vote, local reports say. \"I want to go and visit all those who have supported me, in the small alleyways and the villages, all the invitations I haven't been able to keep because I have been campaigning,\" he said, after thanking his supporters. Mr Widodo has positioned himself as the \"people's man\" and analysts say that this has been a key reason why he has done well in this tight race, says the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Jakarta.

In New York City, some 2,400 street cleaners were working 12-hour shifts to clear the snow from the city's 6,000 miles of roads - but inhabitants were advised to stay at home anyway. Breitbart News editor-at-large John Nolte (@ NolteNC ) sums up the speech by Mr Biden, who was mocked on Twitter for misusing the word \"literally\" and for his over-the-top folksiness. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut and Maine are all on an emergency footing, with millions of residents being warned to stay indoors. Blizzard warnings are in effect for much of the coastal section of the north-eastern US, from Newark to southern Maine. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick had told the press conference an order to stay indoors would be lifted across the whole of Boston and surrounding suburbs, while the state's mass transit system would reopen. Boston police Commissioner Ed Davis said he believed the man being hunted in the Watertown area was a \"terrorist\".

Mr Ryan unsuccessfully challenged Nancy Pelosi for the top Democratic leadership spot in the House of Representatives in 2016, urging his colleagues to embrace a new generation that better reflects the party's priorities. In New Orleans, Mr Bullock moderated a panel discussion on the topic, giving him an opportunity to tout his state's efforts to step into the regulatory void created when the Federal Communications Commission abandoned Obama-era policies prohibiting internet service providers from giving the web traffic of some groups or companies priority over others. Like Mr Sanders, however, he may have trouble winning outside of his home state and the mid-Atlantic. Not only could Patrick compete for the black voters who make up the former vice-president's base, his entry into the race will be seen as yet another sign that the political establishment is uneasy with the performance of Biden's candidacy so far. Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has announced he will be standing as a Democrat candidate in the 2020 presidential election. The Democratic race is still largely up in the air even as the first of the state-by-state votes that will decide which of the contenders challenges Mr Trump for the White House looms in Iowa in February. That track record isn't entirely a blessing, however, as a focus on the Middle East has once again turned attention to Biden's support for the 2003 Iraq War - and his sometimes muddled defence of it. Unlike 2016, when Hillary Clinton largely avoided confronting the Vermont senator for fear of alienating his supporters, his opponents will have no such reluctance this time. A poor performance there could put them both on the back foot only two states into primary season, and it's unusual (though not unprecedented) for someone to win the candidacy from such a position. But it's not all bad news for Mr Biden - he is more popular in states that are more diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire, and the next two contests are in states with large Latino and African-American populations, Nevada and South Carolina.

Rod Dreher: Progressive churches fuel apathy As a practicing Christian of the Hitchens sort (Peter, the good one), I welcome the news that more Americans are willing to identify as atheists. The church's legislative body approved a liturgy for same-sex unions and removed impediments for transgender people to serve as priests. Laughter indeed - but not the sort the liberal bishop was looking for, I fear. According to exhaustive social science data analysed by Robert Putnam of Harvard and David Campbell of Notre Dame, all organised American religion is in demographic decline. The blockbuster growth in American religion is happening among a category the authors dub the \"Nones\" - people who claim no religious affiliation, but most of whom believe in God. This is the \"spiritual but not religious\" crowd. But the Nones number is deceptively low, understating the generational wave now breaking upon the US religious landscape. Among young adults aged 18-29, 30% are Nones, and their numbers are rapidly rising. They chafe at those churches' association with the Republican Party. They're not joining liberal churches, the ones that make a big deal out of welcoming and affirming gays. Instead, young adults increasingly see no reason to go to church at all. In MTD, God, who is \"something like a combination Divine Butler and Cosmic Therapist\", doesn't have to be involved in one's life unless one needs something. At least atheists have the courage of their lack of religious convictions. Christian churches that traded their faith inheritance for a pot of progressive message will not be among them. Seven years ago, atheists were barely a blip. But now they say, \"I guess I'm no religion\" when seven years ago they said \"I guess I'm Christian\". It's a large shift, but it's probably not a passionate one. I give them credit for a 1% atheism bump, max. This attitude was especially marked in Americans aged 16-29, and so David Kinnaman, now the president of Barna, spent the next three years examining why. If that's what religion is, we can do better.

And with limited socialising now a possibility, attention is turning to Britain's pubs, bars and clubs.

The cost of these extras, plus any cut taken by the ordering app and fees paid to the council for using extra land, mean profits will be hard to come by. The answer for clubs, Alex says, might be to still treat each night as an event, with a DJ or band and an admission fee. And it is not just venues that rely on music that need more space.

Bolton Council said it took all safeguarding concerns \"extremely seriously\" and had carried out a full disciplinary investigation when an allegation was brought. That investigation resulted in the termination of Kay's employment in 2014. Kay had been a teacher at BMS since 1996 and had been deputy head since 2008. An investigation was carried out by the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) between January and September 2014. When giving evidence to the panel, he accepted the student, who was over the age of 16, had \"low self-esteem\" and that they were \"not equals\" and he \"should have known better\". The panel concluded his actions were \"sexually motivated\" and the student's \"issues with her self-esteem made her vulnerable\". He was in a position of trust and had crossed professional boundaries, it said. Kay continued to communicate with the student during the investigation, discussed the evidence and sent her messages of a personal nature, the panel found. It heard he had written words to the effect: \"If it's not about you, then I have nothing to worry about\". He had therefore tried to \"mislead the disciplinary investigation\" which amounted to \"misconduct of a serious nature\", it concluded.

The yellow-shirts, founded in 2005, were behind huge street protests that led to the military coup of September 2006 that ousted Mr Shinawatra. The red-shirts began as supporters of deposed former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by a military coup in September 2006. The yellow-shirts represent those opposed to Mr Thaksin and they were the force behind the street protests that led to the 2006 coup. The focus of many red-shirts' campaigning zeal is former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Members are mainly rural workers from outside Bangkok. By then Mr Thaksin - a telecommunications magnate - had governed Thailand for five years. Their first major protest began in March 2009 with a series of sit-ins outside government offices, but quickly escalated. Clashes involving troops, protesters and Bangkok residents left at least two people dead and dozens hurt. But their anger had not gone away and, in March 2010, they called fresh protests in Bangkok aimed at toppling the government. The first bloodshed occurred on 10 April when at least four soldiers and 17 civilians were killed in clashes as the army tried to disperse the red-shirts from one of their two bases in Bangkok. On 19 May armed government troops moved into the red-shirt camp, smashing through barricades. A year on, many of their leaders have been released on bail. Yingluck Shinawatra, Mr Thaksin's sister, led the party to a landslide victory in July 2011 and became Thailand's first woman prime minister. Led by media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul, Chamlong Srimuang, who is a former general with close ties to the king's most senior adviser, the yellow-shirts accused Mr Shinawatra of corruption and abuse of power. They also accused him of inadequate loyalty to the monarchy - and wear yellow because it is the king's colour. In late November they staged a week-long sit-in at Bangkok's two airports, shutting down air traffic and crippling the tourism industry. After weeks of pressure, a decision by the constitutional court decision finally achieved the yellow-shirts' goal. The yellow-shirts called off their protests. As the red-shirt occupation went on in 2010 - and in the months after it was ended - the yellow-shirt position towards the government of Mr Abhisit changed. They could face up to 12 years in jail if convicted of invading a government building and blocking parliament. The \"yellow shirts\" were fiercely opposed to the administration formed by allies of ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra. The former crime carries a sentence of up to five years in prison; with seven more for the latter. A further charge of occupying Bangkok airport for two weeks is still to be formally presented. Mr Thaksin was toppled by a military coup in September 2006 following the annulment of a general election by the courts, and months of street demonstrations against him by the \"yellow-shirts\" - a loose grouping of royalists, ultra-nationalists and the urban middle class. The pro-yellow shirt Democrat Party formed a government in 2008, sparking mass protests by the red shirts. Another court ruling disqualified two pro-Thaksin governments in 2008, which triggered red-shirt protests that culminated in violence in 2010.\n","Lengtg after cut: 988\n","\n","Lobsang Sangay\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 815\n","is a Tibetan-American politician who is the Sikyong of the Tibetan-government-in-exile, officially known as Central Tibetan Administration.

Mr Sangay spoke to the BBC's Adam Brookes at the Kurukulla Buddhist Center in Medford, Massachussetts, about his hopes for a \"genuine autonomy\" for Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution. The Dalai Lama will retain his role as Tibetan spiritual leader. Analysts say he aims to ensure that even if China's government tries to select the next Dalai Lama, the Tibetans will have an elected leader they can look to who is outside China and beyond the Communist Party's control. He will have to lead a global movement that campaigns for Tibetan rights and freedoms under Chinese rule. Mr Sangay says that he will support the Dalai Lama's positions. As a Harvard academic, we have full confidence in him. His Holiness the Dalai Lama's decision to step back from political life is the result of his constant efforts to achieve real democracy for Tibet and its people. Analysts say Mr Sangay faces a tough challenge as the elected head of a government which no country recognises and with China as an opponent which has shown no sign of wanting to compromise. China has again accused the Dalai Lama of encouraging people in ethnically Tibetan parts of China to commit suicide. Mr Sangay told a news conference in Washington that the US should try to get access to areas where Tibetans have set themselves on fire. That is something the Chinese government takes issue with. Nearly 100 Tibetans have set themselves on fire since 2009, many fatally, in apparent protest at Chinese rule. Beijing says Tibet as a region is getting wealthier and that Tibetans have religious freedom. Foreign media are banned from the region, making verifying the self-immolation cases difficult. Six Tibetans were jailed in Gansu province last week on similar charges. Mr Modi welcomed visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping in his home state of Gujarat on Wednesday. Mr Modi gave the Chinese president a personal tour of freedom leader Mahatma Gandhi's house in Ahmedabad city. \"India are hoping to match or better the 65 medals, including 14 gold, they won in the Guangzhou Asian Games in 2010,\" says the Hindustan Times. 1630s-1717 - Tibet involved in power struggles between Manchu and Mongol factions in China. 1951 - Tibetan leaders are forced to sign a treaty dictated by China. 1954 - The Dalai Lama visits Beijing for talks with Mao, but China still fails to honour the Seventeen Point Agreement. 1963 - Foreign visitors are banned from Tibet. 2009 January - Chinese authorities detain 81 people and question nearly 6,000 alleged criminals in what the Tibetan government-in-exile called a security crackdown ahead of the March anniversary of the 1959 flight of the Dalai Lama. 2011 November - The Dalai Lama formally hands over his political responsibilities to Lobsang Sangay, a former Harvard academic. Before stepping down, the Dalai Lama questions the wisdom and effectiveness of self-immolation as a means of protesting against Chinese rule in Tibet. 2012 August - Two Tibetan teenagers are reported to have burned themselves to death in Sichuan province. 2013 June - China denies allegations by rights activists that it has resettled two million Tibetans in \"socialist villages\". In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme, during a visit to Rome for the 14th World Summit of Nobel Laureates, the 79-year-old spiritual leader conceded that he may not have a successor. \"The Dalai Lama institution will cease one day.

Whether an accidental visitor on a ship or brought along as a snack, the boat they were carried on did not appear to stop in Britain. Britain was transformed into an island, separated from mainland Europe and Ireland. Land-dwelling animals were therefore no longer able to migrate from Europe over the seas without a little help. What we're actually seeing might be the long lasting legacy of snails that hitched a ride as humans travelled from the South of France to Ireland 8,000 years ago. You see it in blood groups, in Y chromosomes and some diseases. Details of the work, by geneticists from Trinity College Dublin and archaeologists from Queen's University Belfast are published in the journal PNAS. The ancient Irish genomes show unequivocal evidence for mass migration in both cases. DNA analysis of the Neolithic woman from Ballynahatty, near Belfast, reveals that she was most similar to modern people from Spain and Sardinia. In contrast to the Neolithic woman, the Rathlin group showed a close genetic affinity with the modern Irish, Scottish and Welsh. Intriguingly, the Ballynahatty woman carried a different variant which is also associated with an increased risk of the disorder. This is consistent with data from elsewhere in Europe showing a relatively late spread of milk tolerance genes. Prof Bradley explained that the Rathlin individuals were not identical to modern populations, adding that further work was required to understand how regional diversity came about in Celtic groups. The present-day English owe about a third of their ancestry to the Anglo-Saxons, according to a new study. They brought with them a new culture, social structure and language. From there, the scientists could track the contribution made by those Anglo-Saxon migrants to modern British populations. But Dr Schiffels points out that it is difficult to tell when this genetic component arrived there until DNA from Iron Age remains in those regions is analysed. However, one of the individuals had genetic affinities with people from North Africa and the Middle East, providing evidence of long-scale migration in Roman times. The majority were male, under 45 years old and had been decapitated. The DNA analysis conducted in Dublin formed part of a major international study of dog domestication, led by Oxford University in the UK. It was also contrasted to the DNA of 2,500 modern dogs. Lead author Dr Laurent Frantz from Oxford University agreed saying: \"Reconstructing the past from modern DNA is a bit like looking into the history books, you never know whether crucial parts have been erased. \"Our ancient DNA evidence, combined with the archaeological record of early dogs suggests that we need to reconsider the number of times dogs were domesticated independently. He was one member of an extended \"clan\" that was buried at impressive stone monuments across Ireland. Where they do occur, it is often within royal dynasties that have been granted divine status. The man's remains were laid in a richly decorated recess in the inner chamber. The Middle Irish place name for the neighbouring Dowth passage tomb, Fertae Chuile, is based on this lore and can be translated as \"Hill of Sin\". The ancient genomic survey also uncovered the earliest diagnosed case of Down's syndrome - in a male infant buried 5,500 years ago in the Poulnabrone portal tomb, County Clare. \"He was interred within a sacred place; he was breastfed before his death,\" explained Dr Cassidy. However, their DNA shows they developed a distinctive character after being isolated for centuries. Two individuals from a wedge tomb at Parknabinnia, County Clare, showed high levels of Mesolithic ancestry.\n","Lengtg after cut: 773\n","\n","Hughes brothers\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 853\n","Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, known together professionally as the Hughes brothers, are American film directors and producers.\n","A pair of rugby-playing brothers have succeeded where a former English power lifting champion failed - in picking up a giant stone in a Gwynedd town. Brothers Reuben and Dafydd Hughes, who live nearby, decided to try their luck. \"We decided to go there one Sunday afternoon, quietly, just the two of us and try to lift it,\" explained Reuben, a stone wall and fencing worker. \"I was a bit nervous when I first saw it, but I thought that as I worked with stones almost every day I had a good chance,\" he said. They returned to Criccieth last Saturday and both lifted the stone once more. Mr Davis, who had read of the Criccieth stone in a biography of David Lloyd George, said after his failed attempt that it would take \"a world class strength athlete\" to lift the stone. He said there had been a lot of interest in the stone from around the UK. He was handed a four-year sentence and was told he will serve a year in prison, with the remaining three years on licence upon his release. Two brothers are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter over 39 people found dead in a lorry in Essex. The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, also from Northern Ireland, appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Det Ch Supt Stuart Hooper said: \"Finding and speaking to the Hughes brothers is crucial to our investigation. Irish police, who are liaising with their Essex counterparts, said the man was the driver of a blue truck seized as part of the ongoing investigations into the 39 deaths. News agency Reuters said British police had sent documents relating to four of the dead to Vietnamese police. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021. Essex Police has started extradition proceedings to bring a man from Ireland to the UK to face charges of manslaughter over the deaths of 39 people in the back of a lorry. \"The sooner we can make this happen, the sooner we can progress with our investigation,\" he said. Essex Police have said the brothers are from County Armagh but it is understood they are originally from County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. They have at least one business address in Northern Ireland. All eight women and 31 men are thought to have been adults except one \"young adult\" woman who, police previously said may have been a teenager.

When you go to Google, Bing, Ask or any of the other search engines they only take into account what you, and you alone, are concerned with. That helps to explain, he said, why the results people get back when they type a few words into a search box are far from what that person was really looking for. \"A search result can be good for you but for others it might not be relevant at all,\" he said. As an example, he said, take the search terms \"cheap running shoes\". \"The perfect answer depends on your income level,\" he said. Mr Stocky said social context would get more important as people do more and more searching while they are out and about. Before now, said Mr Lu, search engines have struggled to find a way to reveal who a searcher is and what their lifestyle is like. Bing has signed a deal with Facebook to tap into the connections between its 500 million strong membership. This will mean, said Mr Lu, is that a person's social context will become a filter through which the view the wider web. For those that are happy for Bing to use the data they generate about their friends, subjects they like and places they go, their search results will be reflected through the lens of this data. Before now search engines have been good at helping people find out what is popular as well as the opinions of experts who can give insights into what it is that makes something worth watching or worth ditching. What's been missing, he said, are the words and views of those we trust. Via small files stored on a person's PC called tracking cookies, these firms aggregate your web-browsing experience into a datastream that can be consulted to tailor web services or searches to your needs. In the future instead of typing words into a search box and getting results the information people need will appear when they need it. Facebook has announced a major addition to its social network - a smart search engine it has called graph search. It includes things such as photos, status updates, location data as well as the things they have \"liked\". \"We look at Facebook as a big social database,\" said Mr Zuckerberg, adding that social search was Facebook's \"third pillar\" and stood beside the news feed and timeline as the foundational elements of the social network. Mark Little, principal analyst at research firm Ovum, said he was \"underwhelmed\" by the announcement. Tom Stocky, Facebook's head of search, said in a blog post that many people already turned to Facebook when trying to find out how friends and family were reacting to world events. The post also detailed what Facebook users can do to limit who sees the older posts they shared. \"Facebook has a much wider audience than Twitter,\" said Ms McGarry. Facebook has defended itself over claims its Trending Topics intentionally suppressed stories supporting conservative political viewpoints. It is designed to highlight what subjects are being discussed heavily by Facebook users around the world. Facebook explained in a statement that this list was edited by humans so as to avoid regularly recurring popular topics - such as \"lunch\". Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had \"long suspected\", that \"Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives\". The letter asks Facebook who is responsible for the content on Trending Topics, what steps it is taking to investigate the claims and how many stories with conservative viewpoints have been excluded from the module. The report, by technology news site Gizmodo, alleged that staff tampered with Trending Topic stories and were told to include stories published by the BBC, CNN and other mainstream sites ahead of smaller news sites. But the network's head of search Tom Stocky wrote that the site \"found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true\". \"Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we've designed our tools to make that technically not feasible,\" Mr Stocky said.\n","Lengtg after cut: 884\n","\n","Stevie White\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 780\n","is a British comics artist who works under the pen name Stref.\n","A 79-year-old lollipop lady has died in hospital after being struck by a single decker bus in Ayr, South Ayrshire.

But with the same symptoms at the current stage of the pandemic they would be told to self-isolate at home. The pair, Chinese nationals who were from the same family, had been visiting York when they became ill. As they were thought to have coronavirus they were transferred to the RVI, as it was a specialist centre. Dr Schmid, who is head of infectious diseases, said: \"At the time the situation was classed as being highly dangerous - we had the reports from Wuhan of many patients dying. \"In one way we were very excited, preparing for it the previous weeks and being ready for the situation. Senior sister at the RVI, Margaret Ward, was one of the team who helped care for them. She said: \"I got a phone call at about four in the morning and I immediately dived into the car and came to work. The patients made a full recovery and were discharged on 15 February. Dr Schmid added: \"The patients were actually very well indeed and had mild symptoms. In fact if it had been a few weeks on they would not have been admitted to hospital.

Mr Staley was in the back of the ambulance with the patients during their journey to the hospital, which has a specialist unit for infectious diseases. The family had originally been taken from their hotel in York to Castle Hill Hospital near Hull, before the decision was made to transfer them to Newcastle. The patients arrived there during the morning of 31 January 2020. \"The hardest part of that was both patients spoke very little English, so having to communicate with them with all the PPE on was quite hard,\" Mr Staley said. \"It's quite unbelievable that some people still sort of deny how serious it is.

Ms Evans's lawyers told the High Court that detainees handed over to the National Directorate of Security (NDS), a secret service organisation in Afghanistan, had been tortured. They said detainees had suffered beatings, electrocution, sleep deprivation, been forced into stress positions, and undergone whipping with rubber cables. They also said the process of handing over suspect insurgents to the NDS was \"emphatically not\" compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Speaking outside court, she said: \"We are very pleased with the outcome. Defence Secretary Liam Fox said he also welcomed the ruling. Ms Evans had argued that the legal aid rule changes had partly come about as a result of \"concerns\" expressed by the MoD, under former Secretary of State for Defence Bob Ainsworth, about whether the rules should be changed to stop such cases getting public funding. It would therefore be frankly inimical to the rule of law\". Speaking after the ruling Ms Evans said that in her previous case she had been able to \"shine a light into the dark recesses of the UK's torture policy in Afghanistan, to the benefit of hundreds of prisoners and, ultimately, the British public\". Anti-war activist Ms Evans, 31, from East Sussex, had previously brought a high-profile case challenging an MoD policy of handing over prisoners arrested by British troops in Afghanistan to the Afghan national directorate of security. Mr Ainsworth had tried, but failed, to block Ms Evans from getting legal aid in that case. For some the seaside town's burnt-out pier has come to symbolise its decline.

He added that Defence Secretary Philip Hammond had stopped all transfers of detainees from British forces to the Afghan authorities \"as part of an ongoing review\". Mr Justice Collins said the court would be asked to decide if it was lawful to hand over alleged enemy combatants held by UK forces to the Afghan authorities for possible prosecution. Mr Justice Collins said it was alleged: \"Mr Mohammed was transferred and was tortured and there is evidence, it is said, similar circumstances have surrounded other transferees. Mr Mohammed's lawyers said he was beaten by UK soldiers when he was initially detained in April 2010.

It will go towards Manchester Museum's PS12.7m Courtyard project, which also includes a new temporary exhibitions gallery and new visitor facilities. The Heritage Lottery Fund grant is in addition to PS5m from the government for the South Asia Gallery. A museum spokeswoman said it would make the venue \"more relevant\". Work is due to start in August, with the Courtyard project expected to open to visitors in 2020. With contributions from the British Museum, the South Asia Gallery will also be the UK's first permanent gallery on the region's diaspora. An elephant which refused to board a Victorian train, forcing a 10-day trek from Edinburgh to Manchester, has finally arrived at the city's station. The pachyderm and its trainer had to make the 220-mile walk after Maharajah refused to get into a carriage. Manchester Museum said it was showing exhibits in \"unlikely locations\". Maharajah, and trainer Lorenzo Lawrence, became local legends after making the journey from Scotland. On arrival, Lawrence decided to stay in Manchester with the elephant and became head elephant-keeper at the zoo for over 40 years. The skeleton was put on display at the zoo after Maharajah's death, aged 18, in 1882 before being sold to Manchester Museum. It was housed in the Manchester gallery, which has now been closed - along with several other galleries - to allow a PS13.5m refurbishment to take place. Museum director Esme Ward said in advance of the institution's full reopening in 2021, it would be working with local communities and businesses to display its collections across the city. Maharajah is on display at the station until 16 June. Aboriginal artefacts taken from Australia more than 100 years ago have been handed back by museum bosses. Indigenous leaders visited Manchester Museum to collect 12 items, including sacred ceremonial artefacts and a garment made with emu feathers. Mangubadijarri Yanner said the treasures had been \"taken without our permission\" by early 20th Century British colonialists. Museum director Esme Ward welcomed the Australian visitors \"as friends\". Of the decision to return the pieces, she said repatriation was \"so often framed around what we lose rather than what can be gained\". Christopher Simpson, a director of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, said members of the delegation could not discuss or even describe the \"secret sacred items\" because they are deemed to be \"living beings\". He said he was happy to be working with Manchester Museum because \"what Manchester does today, the world will do tomorrow\". Mr Simpson said he hoped other British museums would follow suit. Donald Bob, elder of the Gangalidda Garawa nation, emotionally described seeing the sacred items for the first time. He said he \"felt cold because it was the person of that thing, that spirit\" speaking to him \"crying for his home\". \"You're saying borrowed, you're saying this and that,\" he said. \"Nah, let's talk about the white elephant in the room: You stole it, you took it without permission, that's theft. The formal repatriation ceremony will take place at Australia House in London on Friday. The Gangalidda Garawa delegation will return to Australia on Saturday.

More than 2,000 bins were cleared from the Square Mile after a truck bomb killed one person and injured 44. Mr Sleigh, who has campaigned for the return of the bins, said litter was particularly bad at the weekends. \"The City is no longer Monday to Friday 9am-5pm,\" he said. A spokesman for the City of London Corporation told the BBC that following the removal of the bins in 1993, City workers had adapted their habits - taking rubbish home with them or putting it in shop bins. However, he said it was a \"special location\" with bars and nightclubs that attract people in the evening. \"The security assessment is different to 1993 - not lower or higher - but the police have been consulted and are okay for this to go ahead,\" Mr Sleigh said. This weekend 20 new blast-proof bins are being introduced on a trial basis after complaints about litter. Bishopsgate councillor Tom Sleigh said it showed the City had \"responded quickly\" to local concerns. The introduction follows two weeks of pre-trial inspections. Experts say the terror attack in 1993, in which nearby buildings were damaged by the shockwaves, marked a turning point in how security was dealt with in the capital, According to the City of London Corporation, there is currently a \"very sparse\" scattering of 39 bins in random locations, such as parks, across the City. But critics have said it is not the public park punters had expected it to be. The building itself does, however, have its fans, with Tom Sleigh, councillor for the City of London's Bishopsgate ward calling it a \"glorious drag queen of a building\" with \"shapely curves\". Land Securities and Canary Wharf Group, which developed the skyscraper, have yet to respond to the criticism. The space is open during the daytime to the public if you book three days in advance, but after 18:00 only customers from one of the three restaurants or bars are able to visit. Even the City of London's former chief planner Peter Rees, who saw the building through its approval stages, says: \"I think calling it a sky garden is perhaps misleading. \"If people expecting to visit it as an alternative to Kew, then they will be disappointed,\" he said. Meanwhile, as the building has gradually made its mark on the skyline, there has been much debate over its aesthetic appeal. \"Lots of people got excited about the public garden idea but it's not a real public garden - instead a private space you have to book to visit three days in advance,\" he adds. He says it is an example of \"what happens when bad planning decisions are taken\". \"The problem seems to be calling it a garden is a subjective term,\" he says. The River Thames Garden Bridge was approved by London Mayor Boris Johnson in December to a very mixed public response. \"London seems to be suffering from a lot of green garden hype at the moment,\" says Mr Reynolds. Of course, this is not the first time the Walkie Talkie has been subject to controversy. What the building's lasting legacy will be remains to be seen. A London councillor accidentally set his notepad on fire while taking part in an online committee meeting. The Labour Party member said he had been trying to light a candle \"but it accidentally ignited my notepaper\" and he had \"badly\" burnt his fingers. Nevertheless, his mishap seemed to go unnoticed and the meeting carried on. The committee meeting was being streamed live online when the fire occurred. He managed to put the flames out quickly but said he had badly burnt his fingers and he had \"plunged them into a cold sink\" afterwards.\n","Lengtg after cut: 790\n","\n","Colin Barnett\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 721\n","is a former Australian politician who was the 29th Premier of Western Australia.\n","There has been anger in Australia over a newly released video which shows an unarmed Aboriginal man being tasered 13 times by police officers.

Religiosity, which is nowhere near as central to Australian politics as it is to American politics, is not as big an obstacle. Nathan Hart, assistant professor at UWA, explained to me that sharks don't see as well as humans. Bubble curtains could be deployed to keep sharks away from popular beaches. An open letter from more than 100 scientists has urged Mr Barnett to reconsider the cull, highlighting its environmental impact and the low chance of catching the individual sharks responsible for the attacks. Last week they posted a video on YouTube showing activists helping a 2.4m-long tiger shark recover, by holding its fins and propelling it through the water. Frankcom, who regained full use of her legs, says the state's politicians are \"petrified that Western Australian has become the shark capital of the world\". In the December issue of the Australian Journal of Political Science, academic Christopher Neff wrote that the idea of \"serial killer sharks\" which must be culled was easier to peddle than explaining to the public that shark culls do not protect swimmers. \"I'm a bit nervous about the word 'close'; when you say that to Aboriginal people in Australia, the hair stands up on the back of their necks because it has an historical premise, because we were forced off our land in 1930s and 1940s,\" he said.

As Australia woke to news that another prime minister had lost his job mid-way through a parliamentary term, views were divided within political circles about what Malcolm Turnbull's ascension to the top post would mean for the country. News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch: \"Sad to see such a decent man as Abbott toppled. \"It is dangerous for any Western society in that it is divisive and it promotes parallel societies,\" she said. Far-right politicians in Australia typically fail at the ballot box. Duncan McDonnell, a senior lecturer at Griffith University in Brisbane, believes the current crop of far-right groups have little chance of electoral success. Frank Mols, a lecturer in political science at the University of Queensland, went to the same high school as the Dutch MP, and believes his visit to Perth is designed to impress voters back home in the Netherlands. Reinforcement firefighters have been brought in from New South Wales to tackle the blaze, while evacuations continue from the area. West Australia Premier Colin Barnett has declared the main area of the fire to be the scene of a natural disaster and eligible for emergency funds. Four firefighters were injured battling the blaze in Yarloop and one fire truck was destroyed. But the national convener of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, Prof David Flint, told the Herald Sun that republicans had not yet settled on a model to replace the current system.

In August 2015, she became the head teacher of Ryde Academy on the Isle of Wight. The Hampshire County Council had been overseeing education on the Isle since 2013 because of concerns over the school's former sponsor, Academies Enterprise Trust, and their lack of regard for the \"welfare or education of students or staff.\" In addition to her role on Educating Cardiff, she has been featured on This Morning with Eamonn Holmes, and was interviewed on Capital FM radio.\n","First Channel 4 educated Essex, then came Yorkshire followed by East London - now it's Cardiff's turn. Educating is back for a fourth series aiming to show real life in schools using a fly on the wall format. But there's also been criticism they focussed too much on bullying, bad language and teen pregnancies. As someone who was once a teacher (all be it a substitute) I can tell you there is just as much bad language in a staff room as there is in the common room. With that in mind the producers have planned a fourth series and to tick another regional box they've decided to head to Wales for the first time. The location will be Willows High School in Cardiff where the head teacher has said she's simply \"delighted\" that the programme will be showing off their high standards. Over the last few years the school has become one of the most improving schools in Wales. The nine-episode series will air in autumn. Commissioning editor, David Brindley, said the series \"promises to unearth more inspirational, humorous and moving stories from the corridors of this characterful Cardiff school\". A head teacher featured on a TV documentary about turning around a failing Cardiff school has taken over as head of an Isle of Wight school. Joy Ballard appears in Channel 4's series Educating Cardiff. Previous head Dr Rory Fox left in February after criticism over uniform policy and comments about staff. Under her three years of leadership, Willows High School in Cardiff became one of Wales' most improved schools. Education on the Isle of Wight has been run by Hampshire County Council since 2013 following concerns over standards on the island. An Ofsted report in 2014 classed Ryde Academy, run by Academies Enterprise Trust as \"requiring improvement\". It highlighted teaching as \"not yet strong enough to ensure that all students make good progress\". The head teacher who rose to fame in the Channel 4 television series Educating Cardiff has won a head teacher of the year award. Joy Ballard scooped the Plato trophy at the Pearson Teaching Awards ceremony in London on Sunday evening in the secondary head teachers' category. After three years there, she now runs an academy in the Isle of Wight. Mrs Ballard left school with no qualifications but was inspired to become a teacher when she returned to education as an adult. One of her students at Willows said: \"A few years ago, it was definitely not cool to do well at our school. The Pearson awards were founded in 1998 by Lord Puttnam to celebrate excellence in education. The ceremony will be broadcast as \"Britain's Classroom Heroes\" on BBC2 at 18:00 GMT on Sunday 25 October 2015. A troubled Isle of Wight academy is set to merge with another school, its sponsor has announced. Academies Enterprise Trust (AET) said it intended to merge it with Ryde Academy to make \"one great school\". It said falling numbers and the consequent impact on finances had prompted the decision. Pupil numbers have fallen to fewer than 1,000 from 1,252 in 2012. In a statement, AET, the biggest academy chain in England, said: \"It has been becoming increasingly difficult for the school to fund the teachers and the educational resources needed in order to provide the education we would all want for the students. If approved, the principal of Ryde Academy, Joy Ballard, will oversee the transition between the two schools.

Hispanics registered to vote in Texas are twice as likely as other groups to lack required photo ID, justice officials said. The states of South Carolina and Wisconsin are also facing legal battles over their voter ID laws. Texas officials say their law, approved in May 2011, aims to deter voter fraud. In a statement, Texas governor and former presidential candidate Rick Perry said the justice department had \"no valid reason for rejecting this important law, which requires nothing more extensive than the type of photo identification necessary to receive a library card or board an airplane\". A federal court in Washington will now decide if Texas, as well as South Carolina, can enforce their new voter photo ID measures. The justice department analysed two sets of data provided by the state and concluded that in both cases, requiring an ID card would disproportionately affect Hispanic voters. In January, the state sued US Attorney General Eric Holder in an attempt to defend the law. In its decision, the justice department noted that one-third of counties in the state did not have offices to obtain a state-issued photo ID, with some residents living more than 100 miles (160km) away. It also argued that the voter awareness process was incomplete. Texas has also battled in court over its redistricting map for the 2012 election year. How Texas' map is drawn could decide whether four seats in the US House of Representatives are won by Republicans or Democrats in November's elections. Democrat Beto O'Rourke lost his Senate bid in 2018, but his failed campaign led to a major overhaul of the criminal justice system in Texas's largest city, writes The Marshall Project's Keri Blakinger. The newly-victorious Houston-area Democrats - including 59 judges and the county's top executive - have tackled the hot-button issue of bail reform and are debating how to make sure that poorer people are represented by lawyers in criminal court. Conservative Republicans, law enforcement officials and the bail bonds industry have loudly condemned those changes, but have not been able to reverse them. The shift in Harris County is part of a broader rethinking of criminal justice across the US. The number has since fallen by half and now accounts for only one in eight new prison admissions. At the same time, the state and county demographics have shifted. Texas is now one of few majority-minority states in the nation - meaning that more than half the state population is made up of minority groups. Amid those changes but \"before Beto,\" Kim Ogg won her 2016 bid to be Harris County's top prosecutor. She's made some progressive moves, such as limiting marijuana arrests and sending fewer people to prison. But the local courts were still largely controlled by Republicans, many of whom opposed cutting back cash bail requirements. The lawsuit argued that the county's reliance on cash bail was unconstitutional because it amounted to a \"wealth-based detention scheme,\" where rich people could pay for their release while poor people would have to stay in jail. Last year, the county and the new misdemeanour judges agreed to a settlement that largely eliminates cash bail for low-level arrests. \"When I ran for office, I was really running to become a defendant in the lawsuit,\" said Judge Franklin Bynum, a self-described socialist who oversees a misdemeanour court. Now roughly 85% of misdemeanour arrestees are automatically released without paying, and the county is beginning to grapple with another bail lawsuit focused on felony cases. Under the new judges in the county's juvenile courts, the number of Houston-area children sent to youth prisons has fallen drastically, from 149 in the first 10 months of 2018 to 54 in the first 10 months of 2019. Some of the changes - including to local bail practices - have already sparked criticism from the police union, whose outspoken leader has sparred with the new judges and district attorney in the past. Answers could come later this year when the district attorney is up for re-election.

Officials said that Sunil Kumar Verma was suffering from depression after being named in the case and shot himself early on Monday. The scam involved the siphoning of money from a federal-funded project to strengthen rural health facilities. Among the 36 people accused is a former state health minister. Mr Verma was project manager in a company that was in charge of building primary and community health centres for the National Rural Health Mission (NHRM). He became \"depressed\" after his home was searched by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) earlier this month, Mr Verma's family told the media. Two health officials named in the case were murdered in 2010 and 2011, while a third accused died in mysterious circumstances in prison. Following the murders, the Allahabad High Court ordered the CBI to take over the investigation of the case. The CBI has carried out searches at the houses of various officials, including bureaucrats and businessmen associated with the state family welfare department. Former state health minister Babu Singh Kushwaha was named by the CBI in the case. He was sacked last year after the two murders. The NHRM was launched by the central government in 2005 to provide basic affordable health care to the poorest in all states. In Uttar Pradesh, where health care is in a dismal state, it was found that millions of dollars allocated for the project had gone missing over the years and no infrastructure had been built.

The other option was for the commandos to use more force, and then there would be criticism for excessive force. They were given orders, specific orders not to use weapons, only if they were under life threat. That's why they were using those weapons. The aim of this flotilla was to focus attention on Israel's three-year blockade of Gaza; it has certainly done that, but at the expense of many lives.

Michael Thorpe, 33, of Outwood Road, Heald Green, Stockport, appeared at Stockport Magistrates' Court charged with aggravated burglary. He is accused of entering the house of Vincent Cooke, 39, in Midland Road, Bramhall, Stockport, on Saturday night. Raymond Jacobs, 39, died from knife wounds he suffered at the house. Mr Thorpe was remanded into custody to appear for trial at Manchester Crown Court on 2 December. Mr Cooke was arrested on suspicion of murder and bailed until 17 October pending further inquiries. Detectives investigating the stabbing said they must determine whether it was \"a criminal act\" or \"self-defence\". The court heard his accomplice Raymond Jacob had died in a \"knife fight\" with home owner Vincent Cooke, whose house the pair had tricked their way into. Thorpe was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The pair went to Mr Cooke's home in Bramhall, Stockport on 17 September 2011 and, posing as gas workers, talked their way inside. Mr Cooke said he picked up a kitchen knife to defend himself from Jacob as he felt he was \"fighting for my life\". \"If I did not stab him first, he would stab me,\" he said.

Rodchenkov made headlines in 2016 after an interview to The New York Times exposing the doping program in Russia. Rodchenkov's allegations were confirmed by the independent McLaren Report, leading to Russia's partial bans from the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics.\n","The Russian authorities are \"concerned\" by new claims of doping among Russian athletes at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, an adviser to Russia's sports minister says.

Mr Rodchenkov was once viewed more favourably by the Russian authorities. At the time, the Kremlin dismissed his allegations as \"slander by a turncoat\".

He was part of the 1990 pool of candidates for the presidency in the Liberal Party.

On August 31, 2011, however, the Colombian Supreme Court voided the State's Supreme Court decision and ratified the original sentence.\n","Colombia's Supreme Court has reinstated the conviction in a murder case against a former justice minister. Alberto Santofimio will serve 24 years in jail for his role in the killing of rival politician and presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan in 1989. Mr Santofimio received the same sentence in 2007 but was released on appeal after spending a year in prison. Relatives of the murdered politician appealed against the decision and the Supreme Court ruled in their favour. Santofimio was a close associate of the late drug baron Pablo Escobar. One of Escobar's henchmen who appeared as a witness said Mr Santofimio met the drug baron several times and often urged him to kill Mr Galan. He said that if Mr Galan ever became president he would intensify the fight against drug trafficking and would extradite Escobar to the United States. Mr Galan was killed during a campaign rally near the capital, Bogota, in 1989. He was the favourite to win the 1990 presidential election. One of Colombia's most notorious hired killers has been released from prison after serving 22 years of a 30-year sentence. Jhon Jairo Velasquez, nicknamed Popeye, was the top hit man of late Colombian drug baron Pablo Escobar. He confessed to killing 300 people and also claimed a hand in up to 3,000 killings in the 1980s and 1990s. But he also gave evidence against an ex-justice minister convicted of ordering the killing of a rival. Velasquez, 52, walked free from the Combita high-security prison on Tuesday to start a probation period of four years. He left under heavy police escort, a sign of the risks he believes he will face outside jail. The BBC's Arturo Wallace in Bogota says Colombia is divided over his early release. Several victims insist he still hasn't paid for all his crimes, while others say that after two decades in jail it is time to give him a second chance, our correspondent says. Velasquez was convicted for his part in the murder of presidential hopeful Luis Carlos Galan in 1989. But he later turned state's witness against former Justice Minister Alberto Santofimio, a rival candidate in the 1990 presidential election, who was convicted of ordering Mr Galan's killing. Mr Galan had taken a hard line against powerful drug cartels and was favourite to win the election, but he was was shot dead in a town outside Bogota as he prepared to give a speech. Santofimio, now serving a 24-year sentence, was a close associate of Escobar - the founder of the Medellin cartel which was engaged in a war against the Colombian state.\n","Lengtg after cut: 954\n","\n","Michael Hammond\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 743\n","is an American linguist and professor at the University of Arizona.\n","A police constable attacked a detective during a rugby match, leaving him needing surgery, a jury has heard.

The following day the British team raced before the Italians. \"He was genuinely delighted for us,\" says Dixon. In an incredible coincidence, East German figure skater Katarina Witt and her biggest rival, Debi Thomas from the US, both chose to dance the part of Carmen - the Spanish gypsy immortalised in Bizet's opera, in the 1988 Games in Calgary. Debi Thomas was representing everything that is good about America, recalls Witt. One of Witt's jumps didn't go as planned leaving her riddled with doubt. When they got to Calgary, Harris was \"scared to death but I was having a ball\". But on the next run the sled hit the wall. \"The next thing I knew my head was hitting the ice.

But these accusations are largely dismissed by the report. CRU scientists were too quick to dismiss critics from outside their own circles, it says.

CRU produces one of the four most widely used records of global temperature. This is the third and most comprehensive review into the CRU issue, and has reached similar conclusions to the previous two.

Under the Climate Change Act, the UK is allowed to relax its targets for reducing emissions if the CCC advises that circumstances have materially changed since the budget was set. But the complainant had argued that its information was often misleading. The Global Warming Policy Foundation made an immediate impact.

It comes at a time when campaigners are urging the government to ratify the Paris climate change deal. But the committee insists that ministers must send the right economic messages to consumers. But it said the Treasury's forthcoming review of climate policies must tackle the issue, as home heating must shift from gas towards low-carbon alternatives. Another sector in urgent need of investment is the cooling of people's homes, the report says.

Writer and railway historian Christian Wolmar is standing for Labour - despite calls from some frontbenchers for the party to stand aside to give the Lib Dems a better chance of winning the seat. Mr Wolmar says his campaign shows there are \"no no-go areas for Labour\", adding that while Mr Goldsmith wanted the by-election to be \"a referendum on Heathrow... the key issue for local people is clearly Brexit\". Remain supporters in Richmond Park are disgruntled about the majority of the country going against them, Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has said. As the new Lib Dem MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, Ms Olney will be the party's only female MP - joining eight male colleagues. But local Tories insist Mr Goldsmith is not a \"hardened Brexiteer\" and would fight for the best deal for Britain. Following Ken Clarke's decision to step down as an MP at this election, Mr Skinner was in line to become the Father of the House - but that mantle now falls to Tory MP Peter Bottomley.

Dan Conway, 28, auctioned himself on eBay, sent pizzas and doughnuts to employers alongside his CV, and even gravy wrestled at the side of a road with EMPLOY ME written on his bare chest. However the stunts all paid off for the creative advertising graduate - as he was headhunted by Vitamins. One job seeker, Dan Conway, tried a host of methods to get himself noticed - and succeeded. Employers receive an average of 60 applicants for every advertisement for a low-skilled job, and 20 for every skilled job. Significantly, almost half of these candidates are perfectly suitable for the role, according to research by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) So that makes their CV - or curriculum vitae - all the more important when attempting to stand out from the crowd. Don't repeat the mistakes, they say, of a lawyer who stressed his \"dew diligence\", or the applicant who ignored commas when describing his interests as \"cooking dogs and interesting people\". If sending a CV as a hard copy, along with a job application, then it needs to be neat and typed if possible. Most libraries have public computers which can be used by those who do not have their own. Increasingly, applicants are asked to send a digital copy of a CV. If this is the case then the first set of \"eyes\" to see it might be an automated search for key words, so experts suggest applicants ensure mandatory requirements in the job advert are included in a CV. Other tips from Mrs Mills, the CIPD, and the National Careers Service include: Dan Conway, 29, from Newcastle, spent four years after university searching for a permanent job in his chosen field of marketing. Frustrated while moving in and out of temporary jobs, he decided he needed to stand out from other candidates. He charted his efforts on a website, which quickly gained attention. He says some of his stunts went viral on the internet and he soon received interest from employers. He now works for one of those companies who got in touch - Vitamins Direct - as head of web sales and online marketing. Mrs Mills says it is important that applicants put modesty aside and show self-confidence in their CV. \"If you are not confident about your skills and abilities then why should an employer have faith in you,\" she says. CVs have been around for years and Ruth Stuart, research adviser at the CIPD, says that she expects their format to evolve as technology changes. Some employers are asking for video CVs, where applicants describe their skills and experience on a short video filmed on their smartphone, or requesting jobseekers complete application forms online. However, she argues that CVs will always be useful. There are plenty of useful tools and templates to assist people writing up their CV for the first time, or brushing up an existing one. The National Careers Service has a CV writing factsheet and a CV builder with various tips and templates. For those looking for a job, a database of jobs held by Jobcentre Plus is a good place to start. In addition, there is a separate database of jobs in Northern Ireland. Skills Development Scotland has advice on finding a job, dealing with redundancy and links to Scotland-specific job sites. Careers Wales has bi-lingual advice covering all these areas and also includes help for jobseekers under the age of 19. CVs can be produced in a different format for job applications outside of the UK. For example, the equivalent of the CV in the US is the \"resume\". This has much the same aims by outlining job talents, work history, education and career goals, as well as how a candidate's experience and skills would be suited to the job being advertised.\n","Lengtg after cut: 793\n","\n","Mel Brooks\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 588\n","is an American director, writer, actor, comedian, producer, and composer.\n","US actor Kenneth Mars, best known for his appearances in Mel Brooks's films The Producers and Young Frankenstein, has died of pancreatic cancer.

The #OscarsSoWhite controversy that dominated the build-up to the Oscars - which focused on the fact that all 20 nominees in the acting categories were white - led to leading black figures in Hollywood, including director Spike Lee and actress Jada Pinkett-Smith, boycotting the event, while Rock himself faced calls to step down as host. There was no way Rock was going to try and avoid or play down what had been happening. As he continued, his targets got wider - and his points sharper. But, as he did when first hosting in 2005, Rock kept things moving along at a real clip.

His early jokes received a mixed response from those watching at home, and some uncomfortable laughter from the show's live audience, especially as he seemed to imply a lack of representation at awards shows was not a serious issue. Others said that such a routine could be instructive. \"[It] left many baffled and reaching for Google. Which is revolutionary in and of itself,\" she said.

Exclusivity Before fashion giants like Gucci and LVMH decided to go large on the internet, they had to be sure that they would be able to maintain the exclusivity of their brands. Louis Vuitton is using the location-based service FourSquare - which lets your friends know exactly where you are - to make people who visit its stores show up as \"Vuitton insiders\". Indeed, one of the most talked-about shows in New York's most recent fashion week was Tom Ford's, who held it in his Madison Avenue store, only invited 100 people and had Beyonce and Lauren Hutton as models.

Mr Museveni has been in power since 1986, and elections are due in 2016. The government has denied having any such plans. Uganda's leading private newspaper, the Daily Monitor, and another newspaper, Red Pepper, last week published a confidential letter, purportedly written by army General David Sejusa, calling for an investigation into allegations of a plot \"to assassinate people who disagree with this so-called family project of holding onto power in perpetuity\".

Scientists are already testing whether giving people extra vitamin D might prevent or ease MS. To better understand the association, investigators at McGill University in Canada compared the prevalence of MS in a large group of Europeans with and without a genetic predisposition to low vitamin D. This type of genetic variation is pretty random and so the assumption is that any link found should be trusted. Some were blood donors while others were tracked down from the group of people first infected in Sweden, mainly returning from earlier affected areas like northern Italy. While theirs is the biggest T-cell study done so far, it still involved a relatively small group of patients. T-cells are very complex and much harder to identify than antibodies, requiring specialist labs and small batches of samples being tested by hand over the course of days. However, officials in the north-western region of Galicia have re-imposed restrictions on an area of 70,000 people following an outbreak. Capacity in bars and restaurants have been limited to 50%. They warned against a \"black and white\" view of Covid as an illness that was either mild or deadly. \"We do not have a system to record this or measure the burden,\" she said. Our immune system is the body's defence against infection and it comes in two parts. But this system is not specific to coronavirus. Instead you need the adaptive immune response. This takes time - studies suggest it takes about 10 days to start making antibodies that can target the coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the strongest immune response. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter. The new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts. The jury is still out on the field of \"cross-reactivity\" but there may be some infections that look similar enough to the virus that causes Covid that people may gain some protection. But the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus. Researchers conclude reinfection is uncommon but still possible and say people must continue to follow current guidance, whether they have had antibodies or not. Another issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn't mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others. Everyone's immune system is unique - some may mount more successful defensive responses than others. And people must continue to follow the current guidance as some may become reinfected and pass the virus on to others, PHE says. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous. Understanding immunity better could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. And the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading. These are all big questions we still lack answers to. And scientists are watching data shared by the country keenly, for signs of how effective the vaccine is when given to a whole population. Given the time it takes for immunity to build and unvaccinated people to become exposed to the virus, incubate it and develop symptoms, the national data would not be expected to reflect the impact of vaccination for at least a month. Health workers with previous Covid-19 infections had six times the immune response to one dose of the Pfizer jab than those who hadn't had the virus. This harder-to-measure part of our immune system tends to respond to lots of different parts of the virus's \"spike\", making it important for protecting against mutations. For people who have not had Covid, the first dose of the vaccine provided protection equivalent to having had the virus.\n","Lengtg after cut: 805\n","\n","Mike Posner\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 925\n","is an American singer, songwriter, poet, and record producer.

Harvey's ninth studio album toppled The Lumineers just a week after they too scored their first UK number one.

According to Mike Smith, managing director of music publishers Warner/Chappell UK, it is simply that the business of making music has changed. \"Think back 20 years and an artist would take at least two or three albums to really hone their craft as a songwriter,\" he told Music Week. Swedish star Tove Lo, who wrote tracks for Girls Aloud and Icona Pop before launching her own career, says \"writing camps\" helped her find her voice as a songwriter. \"They love to give you a bit of a brief, like, 'This song should be uptempo, sassy, girl-meets-guy,'\" says British singer Dyo, a veteran of camps for X Factor contestants, who is up for an Ivor Novello award this week for her hit single Sexual.

Each evening Cardiff Bay will become the venue for a world music Showcase Festival featuring a tapas of world music from around the world. Folk music played a large part in this year's opening ceremony featuring Cerys Matthews and other leading Welsh musicians taking the audience on a journey of Welsh music and culture spanning 30,000 years. Gwenan Gibard, a musician and leading exponent of the tradition chose the track Bum Yn Caru Cainc Y Datgeiniad by one of the old style singers, Einion Edwards, from Meirionydd - a stronghold of the tradition for centuries. Considered by many to be Wales's national instrument, the triple harp was brought to Britain from continental Europe in around 1630. It became popular with harpists in London, many of whom were Welsh and brought it to Wales where it became popular amongst the Gipsy community. The track Pwt Ar Y Bys (Fingering Vamp) shows off the harp's capability and the Welsh tradition to great effect. In many parts of Wales Christmas Day meant attending an early plygain service between 3-6am at the parish church. \"After a short service, the plygain is declared open and anyone in the audience can take part, as individuals or as small parties, the most common party being three people, singing in close harmony. Listen to Ar Gyfer Heddiw'r Bore by Triawd Fronheulog. Welsh ballads are still widely performed in their traditional forms but new generations of musicians are revisiting them and performing the songs in more contemporary styles, ensuring they remain relevant. Due to the work of enlightened individuals such as Lady Llanover in the 18th Century, a good many of Wales' traditional dance reels (folk dance and accompanying dance tune type) have survived. During the Industrial Revolution, migrant workers from across the world flocked to Wales' coalfields, slate quarries and docks. The impact on small, Welsh speaking communities was immense and this period ignited a tradition of mixed language songs known as Macaronic. Cerys Matthews is a huge fan and chose Can Merthyr as one of her favourites. Initially, Macaronic songs were thought to be an oral tradition but handwritten records do exist in the National Library of Wales archives dated 1909. Its words are said to have been sold on the pamphlet of a ballad-singer at Merthyr Tydfil around the mid-19th Century. The 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in Welsh language activism. \"Songs have been a natural medium for expressing strong emotions and political protest for centuries, and here in Wales there is a long tradition of ballads with a strong social and political theme,\" he said. Peintio'r Byd Yn Wyrdd (Painting the world green) grew out of the road-signs campaign for the Welsh language. More and more young musicians are turning to the folk tradition for inspiration and helping to drive creative experimentation and collaborations. Another recent project entitled Mamiaith (Mother Tongue), saw Welsh folk group 9Bach collaborate with Australian group Black Arm Band to explore the poignant theme of lost language. Today, musical tradition in Wales is thriving as younger musicians turn to folk music for inspiration but continue to develop it further with rich musical collaborations around the world. An international harpist from Ceredigion claims he was banned from a bank after complaining about a sign. Robin Huw Bowen said he was told to leave HSBC in Aberystwyth town centre after protesting about the small Welsh language lettering on a welcome sign. The bank said it asked Mr Bowen to leave because his behaviour \"became too disruptive\" but added his comments would be \"fully considered\". The Welsh Language Commissioner called the situation \"totally unacceptable\". He complained to the bank on three occasions but said he was asked to leave by the manager on the fourth. In a statement, the bank said: \"We work hard to provide Welsh language services and have a close relationship with the Welsh Language Commissioner to help inform how we best communicate with our customers. \"We have shared Mr Bowen's concern about our welcome sign with our own Welsh language team as we take feedback seriously and will make sure it is fully considered.\n","Lengtg after cut: 955\n","\n","Amy Kremer\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 877\n","is an American political activist known for her roles in the Tea Party movement and as a supporter of Donald Trump.\n","Day in a Nutshell President Barack Obama has jumped back into mid-terms campaigning with a trip to Rhode Island, the smallest state in the US, to back Providence Mayor David Cicilline and other Democrats.

Mr Cornyn's and Mr Sessions's comfortable wins prompted speculation that perhaps the Tea Party movement was losing steam in one of its most sympathetic states. Since then, many congressional lawmakers have adopted tea party rhetoric in order to inoculate themselves from similar attacks. A closer look at the election results reveal that the Tea Party had a pretty good day, however. The aforementioned Mr Dewhurst took it on the chin yet again, this time in his re-election bid for what is considered the most powerful office in the state, lieutenant governor. Amy Kremer, the head of a Tea Party Express, says this shows the movement is \"alive and well\". \"Tea Party candidates won big on the local and state level, and while the tea party lost one congressional race, there was no serious primary challenge in the Senate race,\" she told CNN. \"Also, Ted Cruz endorsed five candidates, with four of them winning and one heavily favoured in a runoff. All of this has the Dallas Morning News's Tod Robberson, a self-proclaimed centrist, lamenting the state's primary system: In several races, we are going to wind up with an arch-conservative tea party type who wins the primary and will represent the GOP in the general election.

Denmark is on high alert after a gunman in Copenhagen killed one person and injured three at a free speech debate attended by a Swedish cartoonist. Several dozen shots were fired at the seminar and a manhunt is now under way. Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt described it as a \"politically motivated\" act of terrorism.

He told the Associated Press news agency that he believed he was the intended target of the attack. \"I'm not shaken at all by this incident,\" he added.

Mia Bloom from the Center for Terrorism and Security Studies at the University of Massachusetts Lowell provocatively argued that women are seen as little more than \"baby factories\" in the desire to populate the new \"purist\" Islamic state. However this does not mean the young women simply want to find a husband. The \"jihadi bride\" concept is only part of the story. In this new 'state', women have all kinds of jobs and functions. It is this combination of violence and domesticity that many find jarring. \"I had a pistol in my belt, a grenade in my pocket and TNT in my bag. Leila Khaled was probably the most famous female hijacker in the world in the late 1960s - beautiful, dangerous and politically committed to doing whatever might further the Palestinian cause. She even subsequently resorted to painful plastic surgery to hide her famous face so she could carry on participating in hijack operations without being recognised. The history of women and terror goes back further still. Today Leila Khaled and Zohra Drif look back on what they did with pride.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in July 2015 that IS had used as many as 19 children as suicide bombers.

S11-S13 are allocated to visual impairments and S14 for those with an intellectual disability. \"When they deliberately cheat it's the same as taking drugs. The ball used in blind football is less bouncy than a regular one and contains ball bearings to make it audible. The goalkeeper is fully sighted but is not allowed to leave his area. Although it is played competitively in more than 50 countries, it is one of the least well-known Paralympic sports. The BC3 class players are unable to propel the ball themselves, so a lightweight ramp is put in place to aid its movement towards the target. \"The person who is their assistant has their back to the court so they are unable to see any of the play and they're totally directed in the movement of the ramp by the athlete\". The venues have increased their wheelchair capacity by removing and rearranging the existing seating - the stadium will have 568 spaces compared with 394 during the Olympics. Blind spectators will be supplied with audio guides, while those with hearing impairments will be seated with a direct view of large screens so they can follow the action. Standing at each end of the pool is a person holding a long pole with a soft circular ball on the end. As the swimmer approaches they are tapped on the head. \"The pole looks a bit like a fishing rod,\" says Marcelo Sugimori, one of two tappers in the Brazilian Paralympic team. \"We tap the swimmer when they are between two and four metres from the end of the pool,\" he adds.

A number of women are having to undergo hysterectomies to remove a sterilisation device used on the NHS, the Victoria Derbyshire show has found. The Essure implant is used to permanently sterilise women, but can cause side effects and complications. One woman - who later had her uterus removed - said she was left suicidal due to the \"unbearable\" pain, and felt she was a burden to her family. The manufacturer says Essure is safe and the benefits outweigh the risks. Manufacturer Bayer has asked hospitals in the UK not to use the device during this time. Laura Linkson, who was fitted with the Essure device in 2013, said the pain left her suicidal. \"I went from being a mum who was doing everything with her children, to a mum that was stuck in bed unable to move without pain, at some points being suicidal. \"I felt like I was a burden on everyone around me,\" she added. They are inserted into the fallopian tubes where they trigger inflammation, causing scar tissue to build up and eventually block the tubes, known as a hysteroscopic sterilisation. They can cause intense pain, and some women are thought to react badly to the nickel and plastic. Victoria Dethier was implanted with Essure in 2012 and for three years could not work out why she felt so unwell. \"There were moments where I couldn't get out of bed I was in so much pain. She thinks her body was reacting to the PET fibres designed to cause inflammation. She had a hysterectomy to remove the device in 2015. \"Straight away there was a difference, I'd experienced a horrible taste in my mouth and that had gone,\" she explained. Carl Heneghan, from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, has criticised the regulator's failure to act on such findings. However, the clinical trial that led to the device being approved has been criticised for not considering the long-term effects of the implants. \"The trial... only followed up women for one year, so nobody has a real understanding of what happens with this device after two years, three years, five years,\" Mr Heneghan explained. Some women who have experienced problems say they were not informed about the risks. \"I think it has a place for women who can't have keyhole surgery and who are explained the risks very carefully,\" he said.

Mikhail Popkov, 53, has confessed to 59 additional murders between 1992 and 2010, Interfax news agency reports. If convicted, that would make him Russia's most prolific serial killer in recent history. He has been dubbed \"the werewolf\" and the \"Angarsk maniac\" by Russian media. Popkov is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2015 of raping and killing 22 women, and attempting to murder two more. The murders are said to have taken place in and around his home city of Angarsk, near Irkutsk, both while he was a police officer and after he left the service in 1998. His victims and alleged victims were all women between the ages of 16 and 40 apart from one male, a policeman. Prosecutors say Popkov killed them after offering them lifts late at night, sometimes in a police car, while he was off-duty. He was arrested in 2012 during a re-examination of the evidence, which involved the DNA testing of people who drove a make of car whose tracks were found at the scenes of murders. If convicted of all 81 murders, the number of victims would exceed those of \"chessboard killer\" Alexander Pichushkin, who killed 48 people, and Andrei Chikatilo, convicted of 52 murders during the Soviet era. A Siberian policeman described as Russia's most prolific mass murderer in modern times has been given a second life sentence. Mikhail Popkov, 53, murdered 55 women and a policeman near Irkutsk between 1992 and 2007. He was already in jail for 22 other murders. He killed the victims after offering them late-night rides in his car. Popkov was caught in 2012 after a DNA match identified his car. The victims were all women between the ages of 16 and 40 apart from one male, a policeman. In three cases he was on duty in his police car. Popkov killed them around the city of Angarsk, near Irkutsk, with an axe and hammer. He dumped their mutilated bodies in forests, by the roadside and in a local cemetery. He claimed to be \"purging\" Angarsk of what he saw as immoral women. The death toll exceeds the 48 murdered by \"chessboard killer\" Alexander Pichushkin, and the 52 murdered by Andrei Chikatilo during the Soviet era. Tyre marks from Popkov's Niva car were found next to some of the bodies, which led police to check all owners of that Niva type in Angarsk. The owners' DNA was checked against DNA found on the victims, and that enabled police to identify Popkov. He was arrested en route to Vladivostok, in the far east, where he had gone to buy a new car. His youngest victim was a 15-year-old girl. An Irkutsk court found him guilty of 22 murders in 2015 and sentenced him to life, but he was kept on remand as the investigation had already started into the other murders. Interfax news agency says he told a cellmate that he had killed more people than Chikatilo. Popkov was found to be sane but with a \"pathological attraction to killing people\", according to prosecutors. Some of his victims were found alive but died later in hospital.

Mr Dershowitz's views on the efficacy of state-authorised torture have also been a lightning rod of controversy. In January 2002 he wrote an opinion piece for the San Francisco Chronicle in which he recommended that the US government be allowed to torture terrorism suspects after obtaining a court order. \"An application for a torture warrant would have to be based on the absolute need to obtain immediate information in order to save lives coupled with probable cause that the suspect had such information and is unwilling to reveal it,\" he wrote.

The health board's figures also showed that since 2002-03 it has helped to provide 4,896 homeopathic treatments. \"And quite often the homeopathy is the one that does work. Her comments follow the release of her first annual report which says it costs Highland PS15m a year to treat illness caused by drink, smoking and obesity. She told BBC Radio Scotland: \"We have a particular concern with alcohol in Highland. There were 236 cases, 47 more offences for the same time in 2009. Booze has been an age-old problem for police and health professionals in the Highlands and Islands. Merkinch in Inverness and Dunoon were among the most deprived areas, according to the NHS Highland report. Alness, the south side of Wick and Campbeltown were also listed among the most deprived places in the health board's area. The least deprived locations included Lomond Shore, rural parts around Nairn and the Inverness areas of Culloden, Balloch, Scorguie, Lochardil and Holm Mains. Dr Somerville also told councillors that alcohol abuse was a key concern. The health board said there was an \"over provision\" of alcohol in Caol and Mallaig, Cromarty Firth and on Skye. Last week, irresponsible drinking was described as \"the curse of the Highlands\", by councillor Kenneth MacLeod during a presentation to Highland Council by Dr Somerville on the state of the region's health. But the Faculty of Homeopathy says it is \"not accurate\" to say there is no evidence for homeopathy. The health board spends PS240,000 a year providing homeopathy services, which is 0.017% of its annual budget. It has launched a consultation on whether it should follow NHS Highland, which removed its funding 2010. The NHS Lothian consultation document, released ahead of its first public meeting in Musselburgh on Thursday, says many clinical trials have been conducted to test whether homeopathic remedies are effective. \"We didn't feel it was very fair or unbiased and it certainly has no scientific foundation,\" she says. Dr Eames also says that, within the NHS, homeopaths tended to treat \"medically-unexplained conditions\" and many patients were referred after conventional medicine had failed to improve their problems. \"It comes out clearly in research that homeopathy is better than placebo for conditions like that,\" says Ms Eames.

He was later a confidante of Nicolas Sarkozy and was arrested for questioning over allegations of Libyan influence in the 2007 French elections.\n","Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been taken into police custody for questioning over allegations that he received campaign funding from the late Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. Police are investigating alleged irregularities over the financing of his 2007 presidential campaign. Police have questioned him previously as part of the probe. The centre-right politician failed to return to power in 2012. Judicial sources said he was being questioned in Nanterre, a suburb in western Paris. In 2013, France opened an investigation into allegations that his campaign had benefited from illicit funds from Gaddafi. The sources said one of Mr Sarkozy's former ministers and a close ally, Brice Hortefeux, was also being questioned by police on Tuesday. A former aide, Alexandre Djouhri, is fighting extradition to France after being arrested in London in January on suspicion of money laundering as part of the case. The Swiss businessman has denied the allegation and says the investigation is politically motivated, according to Reuters news agency. The claims about funding from Gaddafi came from a French-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine, and some former Gaddafi regime officials. The investigation has not reached that stage yet. \"Garde a vue\" - custody - means he can be held and questioned by police for up to 48 hours. Then he may appear before a judge and may face charges. French media say it is the first time that police have detained him over the Libya allegations. In November 2016, Ziad Takieddine told the French news website Mediapart that in 2006-2007 he had handed over three suitcases stuffed with 200- and 500-euro notes to Mr Sarkozy and Claude Gueant, who was his chief of staff. Mr Takieddine alleged that the cash came from Gaddafi and totalled EUR5m (PS4.4m; $6.2m). Mr Gueant, who was managing Mr Sarkozy's presidential campaign at the time, told the franceinfo website on Tuesday that he had \"never seen a penny of Libyan financing\". He was placed under formal investigation earlier this year over a EUR500,000 bank transfer in 2008. He has denied wrongdoing and claimed the money came from the sale of two paintings. French daily Le Monde reported that Bashir Saleh, who ran Libya's sovereign wealth fund at the time, had confirmed that Gaddafi financed Mr Sarkozy. Possible charges in this case would be influence peddling, fraud, handling of stolen goods and money laundering. It is alleged that he engaged in accounting fraud to overshoot the ceiling for campaign expenditure in 2012, which was EUR22.5m. Mr Sarkozy denies he was aware of the overspending. The affair is known as the Bygmalion scandal. In connection with his 2007 campaign, Mr Sarkozy was previously cleared over claims that he had used secret funding from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt and that he had tried to influence investigating magistrates. He is being investigated for illicit campaign financing, misappropriation of Libyan public funds and passive corruption. He was released on Wednesday following two days of questioning over the financing of his 2007 campaign. He says his Libyan accusers are seeking vengeance for his decision to deploy French warplanes during the uprising which overthrew Gaddafi in 2011. The centre-right politician failed in his bid to return to power in 2012, losing to socialist Francois Hollande. Mr Sarkozy was detained in 2014 in a separate investigation into alleged campaign funding abuses - the first time this has happened to a French ex-president.\n","Lengtg after cut: 750\n","\n","Chaim Topol\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 770\n","is an Israeli actor, singer, comedian, voice artist, film producer, author, and illustrator.

Topol began his acting career during his Israeli army service in the Nahal entertainment troupe, and later toured Israel with kibbutz theatre and satirical theatre companies. Topol went on to appear in more than 30 films in Israel and the United States, including Galileo, Flash Gordon and For Your Eyes Only. In 2015 he was awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement.\n","It's exactly half a century since the premiere of Fiddler on the Roof - among the most successful stage musicals written to date. Fiddler on the Roof was the fifth show written by lyricist Harnick and composer Jerry Bock. \"Years before, a friend sent me a novel called Wandering Star about a travelling Yiddish theatre group in eastern Europe. I loved it so I asked Joe Stein would it work as a musical. \"Joe said it was too big and had too many characters but we dug out other pieces by the same author, Shalom Aleichem. \"People thought it was the great Jewish musical which obviously is thrilling. But I've been watching audiences react now for 50 years and at heart the story is about family. \"Jerry would put the music onto tape as piano pieces. It could be a wonderful waltz or I might pick up on a little march theme. It was a five-week run and Harold Prince, the producer, told me we had no bookings after the third week and disaster loomed. \"But you just get on with fixing the show. He got bored and a bored star can be problematic. \"He would create bits of stage business to delight the audience and stop the show. In London, the role of Tevye was taken by Israeli actor Chaim Topol, who went on to star in the 1971 film. \"My first show had been a five-week flop and She Loves Me (1963) was what people politely term a 'succes d'estime' - meaning it got good reviews but didn't pay off the investors. So I think you could call Fiddler's success comforting for everyone concerned. But tensions arose and the writing team hailed as the new Rodgers and Hammerstein split up. Today he's often asked to give advice to young would-be composers and lyricists. \"My first advice to anyone who wants to write lyrics is simple - read widely. \"You never know what your assignment is going to be.

At 90, Harnick still goes to almost every new musical on Broadway. \"For one thing I'm a Tony voter so I'm required to see them and at today's prices that saves me thousands of dollars. A new staging of Fiddler on the Roof is due on Broadway next year. In the meantime Harnick still takes an interest in productions around the world. Actor Chaim Topol has been honoured with the prestigious Israel Award for lifetime achievement. However Topol told Associated Press he was \"not complaining\". Younger Israeli audiences will know his voice from dubbing the Hebrew-language version of The Jungle Book and two of the Harry Potter films. \"Obviously, when you are successful in a film and the money flows, yes, obviously, it is very nice.

A climber who battled through relentless storms to complete all of Scotland's 282 Munros in one winter round has said it feels odd to be stuck at home due to the coronavirus outbreak. Kevin Woods, from Glasgow, is believed to be only the third person to have achieved the feat in a winter season following in the footsteps of the late Martin Moran and Steve Perry, who both died last year in separate climbing accidents. The 28-year-old, who started the continuous trek on Ben More on Mull in December finished it in 97 days on Ben Lomond. He is no stranger to Scotland's Munros, mountains over 3,000ft, (914m) having finished his third round just one month before he started the epic winter challenge. Mr Woods said the majority of the trip was self-supported, using a van to travel between the mountain ranges. He walked an estimated 1,400 miles (2,300 km) - almost the equivalent of hiking from Edinburgh to Rome. He climbed approximately 460,000 feet (140,000 metres), which is similar to scaling the highest mountain in the world, Everest (8,848m), 15 times. The freelance filmmaker, slept in his van, but also camped, used bothies, hostels and stayed with friends. He said some of the scariest times were periods of \"relentless storms in the north-west Highlands in February\". \"Imagine the van being rocked by wind, pounded by hail showers, lightning going off all around - it makes any summit a distant prospect,\" he said. His challenge was almost aborted four days in after he went over on his ankle on Ben More, near Crianlarich, on Christmas Day, but \"it all turned out OK and was mostly drama-free\". Mr Woods gave regular progress updates on his Instagram account and was aware from afar of the coronavirus outbreak. He said he was grateful to have completed the first half of the challenge in \"quick time\" as the UK went into lockdown giving him \"time in hand to finish the Munros ahead of the virus\".

Councillor Mike Mendoza, whose ward the rink comes under, said the council had received a number of complaints from residents of \"unneighbourly behaviour\".

A ferryman who died while working on a footbridge may still be commemorated in a West Sussex town after a campaign to name a bridge after him failed. Campaigners had called for Shoreham's new PS10m swing bridge to be named after Harry Elmer, who died in 1940. But Mr Elmer's name failed to be shortlisted following a competition that invited residents to submit names. Mike Mendoza, chairman of Adur District Council, said Mr Elmer could still be remembered, along with other nominees. He said individuals had not been selected because the panel felt \"there were so many names it would be unfair to choose one\". Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Mendoza said: \"I had a thought over the weekend that because there were so many individual names, maybe we should have some type of tribute to these people that would be put forward. The original budget of PS5.8m nearly doubled to PS9.8m during the construction of the bridge. The new bridge replaces the old structure, after its foundations had \"taken a pounding\" over the years and it could not be economically repaired. Public voting for the winning name will take place online with a winner due to be announced at the end of June. The new bridge is due to open to the public in September.

Mr Tsipras's speech is, perhaps, an olive branch extended from Athens after hardline pre-election rhetoric, but there is no sign that the new government will back down on its opposition to austerity. The Athens Stock Exchange fell by 9% in response to Mr Tsipras's remarks on Wednesday as it emerged that his Syriza-led government was putting on hold major privatisation projects, including the port of Piraeus and the main power company, the Public Power Corporation of Greece. He defended Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who was sidelined from Greece's negotiating team on Monday. Between 30 and 40 MPs, seen as hardline leftists, do not want a deal with the eurozone at any cost and it is thought Mr Tsipras called the referendum because he could not have secured their backing in parliament for a deal. Much of the debt negotiation with the EU has been carried out by Western-educated ministers who are strongly in favour of remaining in the eurozone. To these can be added Parliament Vice-President Alexis Mitropoulos, who says he does not want the responsibility of leading Greece out of the eurozone. The eurozone says Greece has submitted no new proposals to secure a deal with creditors, ahead of a key meeting of the group's leaders in Brussels. Greek media are reporting that the reforms will be put to the Greek parliament on Friday for approval. Reports on Saturday suggested that German ministers were drawing up a plan that would allow Greece to exit the eurozone temporarily if this weekend's talks fail - something Athens says it is not aware of. Of immediate concern is how to fill Greece's short-term cash needs, with the country facing a big payment to the IMF next week. Battle over eurozone's future Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said it was \"extremely important\" for the vote on financial and judicial reforms to pass so that talks on the bailout could begin on Friday. The measures due to be presented to parliament on Wednesday are of a more structural nature, including: More contentious measures - phasing out early retirement and tax rises for farmers - have been pushed back to August. Mr Tsipras has said that he is not happy with the measures imposed by creditors but that his government was forced to choose a \"difficult compromise\" to avoid Greece exiting the eurozone. Germany is confident that its struggling eurozone neighbour Greece will secure the funding it needs to pay its bills. \"There won't be a figure that rolls out... the figure will only come at the end of the programme,\" he said. Time was beginning to press for this payment. EU creditors have agreed to start talks on possible debt relief for Greece as the country prepares to leave an eight-year bailout programme. The IMF says Greece's debt is \"unsustainable\" and has insisted on substantial relief from European creditors as a condition to join the current and third bailout, which ends in August. Such an idea was first proposed by France and would see more relief should Greece's economic growth disappoint in the future, Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece's Finance Minister, was quoted by the Financial Times newspaper as saying. EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the agreement meant \"the Greek crisis ends here\".\n","Lengtg after cut: 687\n","\n","Andrey Kurkov\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 790\n","is a Ukrainian novelist and an independent thinker who writes in Russian. Kurkov, who has long been a respected commentator on Ukraine for the international media, notably in Europe and the United States, has written assorted articles for various publications worldwide.\n","Ever since Viktor Yanukovych came to power as Ukrainian president almost a year ago, the big question has been whether he would bring the country back under Russian influence. Acclaimed Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov argues that he has been far more preoccupied with staying in power. Ukraine's new year celebrations were cautious. Ordinary Ukrainians have their own opinion. Yulia Tymoshenko is Mr Yanukovych's chief political opponent. The Americans worked for several months and left in silence. Now we are into a slow and boring war, the motivation for which resembles corporate revenge. She was held in custody during Leonid Kuchma's presidency and, if she becomes the next president, corporate vengeance will continue and members of the present government will be sent to prison. However, even Ukrainian children know that the legal system is totally in the hands of the president, and almost totally corrupt. But all the while, the president and those around him are clearly moulding a Russian form of government and, if possible, they would like to reform the country into a \"controlled democracy\" as in neighbouring Russia. However, I would not call Mr Yanukovych a \"pro-Russian\" president. He had promised the electorate that Russia would reduce Ukrainian gas prices. Evidently, he was counting on that when he signed an agreement allowing the Russian Black Sea fleet a 25-year extension on their use of a base in the Ukrainian city of Sebastopol. The failure of the 2004 Orange Revolution robbed the average westward-looking Ukrainian of any enthusiasm for politics. Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian writer, best known for the satirical 2001 novel Death and the Penguin. Here he gives his viewpoint on how they have radicalised his country. In Russia and Ukraine they say \"The way you greet the year is the way you will spend it\". Ukraine is a country where victory for any one side is impossible. Good that the president decided to choose talks, not tanks, at the last moment. He would hang on till the end - and the end was approaching at speed. Ukrainians have never known the rule of law but an increasing number of people understand what it could be, and know it to be desirable. Perhaps, if Ukraine did not have its western regions, with Lviv at the centre, it would be easy to turn the country into another Belarus. No-one is in any doubt as to how concerned Russia is about Ukraine's future. Now Russia is waiting to see how the situation will develop. This war, officially called an Anti-Terrorism Operation, has continued for some months. On 29 November, for the first time since Ukrainian independence, the special forces police or \"Berkut\" used violence against protesters, sparking mass protests which, as it turned out, the president and his entourage could not control. Many realised that Viktor Yanukovych would hold on to power to the last, but at the time few considered where this hatred of him came from, a hatred that roused hundreds of thousands of people from their usual state of political apathy and sent them to Kiev's Maidan to stand under the blows of police truncheons and the deadly aim of expert snipers. It took shape back in 2010 when Mr Yanukovych first became president. In Western Ukraine, the local elite were replaced by \"specialists\" from other regions and republics of the USSR. That policy gave rise to a guerrilla war that lasted for 15 years. Had the revolution not succeeded, President Putin would not have annexed Crimea, there would be no war in Donbas and Russian nationalists and Russian secret services, together with pro-Russian activists, would not have tried to incite uprisings against Kiev in Odessa and other cities in the south-east.\n","Lengtg after cut: 790\n","\n","Peter Schouten\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 862\n","is an Australian artist and illustrator of publications in the field of zoology and palaeontology.\n","A man has been found guilty of murdering his pregnant wife and disposing of her body 20 years ago. Debbie Griggs has not been seen since she disappeared from the family home in Deal, Kent, on 5 May 1999. The body of Mrs Griggs has never been found. Mr Atkinson said Griggs had been \"seeking to blacken Debbie's name\". For 20 years, the disappearance of Debbie Griggs remained a mystery. Two decades later, her husband has been convicted of her murder and jailed for a minimum of 20 years. Det Supt Paul Fotheringham, who leads the major crime unit in Kent, did point out that the passage of time helped undermine her husband's claim that 34-year-old Mrs Griggs had walked out of her own accord: there had been no sign of her on any government system in the two decades since she was last seen at the family home in Walmer, Deal, in Kent. Det Supt Fotheringham, who was a young beat officer in Deal at the time of Mrs Griggs's disappearance, said he had always believed Griggs had killed her and that the case had remained in \"the forefront of my mind\". Helen Cheeseman, who was Mrs Griggs's best friend from the age of 12, said police had been \"misdirected\" by Griggs's claims his wife had depression. \"That's why they were looking for a missing person,\" she said. Griggs mentioned depression within 30 seconds when, 24 hours after he claimed she had stormed out, he phoned police to report his wife missing. When concerned neighbours inquired as to her whereabouts, he said she had been behaving like a \"madwoman\" and had \"not been taking her pills\". Long before he murdered his wife, Griggs had begun to do the groundwork. Mrs Griggs wrote in her diary that her husband accused her of being \"sick and mad in the head\". According to Mrs Dineley, our understanding of mental health issues has \"changed greatly over the past 20 years\". Davina James-Hanman, who has spent a 30-year career trying to improve the prosecution and prevention of domestic abuse, currently conducts domestic homicide reviews for the Home Office. There has been a \"process of massive change\" in the criminal justice system's treatment of domestic abuse, she said. Ms James-Hanman, a trustee of the Centre for Women's Justice, was part of a wide-ranging review of the \"inadequate\" way police and prosecutors handle domestic violence cases, published in 2004. \"From that moment on things really started to shift. Public understanding of domestic abuse has also improved, she said. Deborah Elizabeth Cameron was born in December 1964, the eldest daughter of a large and loving family with deep roots in the seaside town of Deal. She trained as a nurse, working first at the Kent and Canterbury Hospital and later looking after disabled children. \"Debbie would never have walked out on her children,\" her friend said. In May 1999, Mrs Cheeseman's son Barry was diagnosed with cancer for the second time. Marian Duggan, a senior lecturer in criminology at the University of Kent, makes a similar case. And although such cases are rare, it is estimated there are about two \"no body murder\" trials in England and Wales each year. It is illegal in the UK to ask jurors about how they arrived at their verdict, so it will never be known how they reached the decision that Griggs had been lying about his wife's death for 20 years. In a 2003 TV appeal, Patricia Cameron said that, while she always knew what had happened to her daughter, she desperately wanted it to be \"made public\", so she could \"close a chapter in my life and hopefully turn a page and start living again\". Progress came too late for Mrs Cameron, who died in January, just a few weeks before her daughter's killer was charged. Kent Police said in a statement: \"Debbie's disappearance was initially investigated as a missing persons inquiry, as was appropriate and proportionate given the missing person report and lack of any evidence at the time that she had come to harm.\n","Lengtg after cut: 862\n","\n","Ferne McCann\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 669\n","is an English model, television personality and presenter.

Arthur Collins, ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, is accused of throwing the substance in the Mangle nightclub in Dalston, on 17 April. The court was told Mr Collins allegedly heard Makai Brown - one of the people injured in the attack - talking about spiking a girl's drink in the club. Clubbers shielded their faces and rubbed ice on blistered skin after acid was thrown over a packed dance floor, a court has heard. He said Mr Collins, the ex-boyfriend of The Only Way Is Essex star Ferne McCann, had also initially told police \"no comment\" when he was questioned over the attack on 28 December 2015. \"What he's done is give people life injuries,\" she added. Just hours before the attack, McCann, who first found fame on reality TV show The Only Way is Essex, was with Collins at a barbecue, breaking the news of her pregnancy to her family. Arthur Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, threw the corrosive substance at revellers in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 April. Collins told the court during the trial he had been at the club celebrating the news of Ms McCann's pregnancy, which the couple had revealed to her family the previous day. Arthur Collins was found guilty on Monday of carrying out the acid attack that left 22 people injured.

He is among four men protesting in London on Monday against a tightening of the criteria for compensation in so-called \"miscarriage of justice\" cases. Mr George says he \"lost everything\" while serving eight years in prison. The MoJ said only people who proved their innocence could get compensation. Mr George was convicted of murdering Jill Dando in 2001 but was acquitted of the killing at a retrial in 2008 after doubt was cast on the reliability of gunshot residue evidence. His family has tried and failed twice to get compensation for him and are now campaigning for a change in the law. Mr George, along with three other men who have had their convictions quashed - Victor Nealon, Martin Foran and James Boyle - will protest later outside a global law summit taking place in central London. The government introduced new legislation in 2014 which made changes to the compensation scheme, creating a statutory definition of what constitutes a \"miscarriage of justice\". Now compensation is only paid when the court quashes a conviction because a new fact has emerged to show beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did not commit the offence. In an interview with Radio 5 live Breakfast, Mr George's sister Michelle Bates said: \"In the British justice system you are innocent until proven guilty. \"To say that Barry should prove his innocence after his conviction was quashed is ridiculous. There is no court in the land where you can prove your innocence. \"When you've had your whole life ripped to shreds, and you have been so hugely damaged just from being in the environment of a prison, you come out and there is no assistance given to you, no counselling. Mr George described being harassed and \"hounded\" by the police and media since his release from prison. \"Not one police officer has come to my knowledge to my family or my legal team and said, 'We're sorry, there was a tragic mistake, we pursued the wrong person,'\" he said. He said that while he was in prison all his possessions were taken from his flat and nothing was ever returned. He said: \"I've never received a penny - absolutely nothing. The Metropolitan Police said the Jill Dando murder case remained unsolved but any new information would be thoroughly examined. Cladding has not been removed from two residential tower blocks in Hampshire, more than two months after the Grenfell Tower disaster. Horatia House and Leamington House in Portsmouth have aluminium composite cladding which has been identified as a \"fire risk\" in tests. Resident Tony Snook said the city council had \"dawdled\" over the work. The authority said the delays were due to preparation work, including booking scaffolding and ground surveys. At least 80 people are thought to have died in the Grenfell fire in North Kensington, west London, on 14 June. Aluminium cladding is thought to have contributed to the spread of the blaze. Mr Snook, who lives on the 16th floor of Leamington House, said he was \"annoyed\" that Portsmouth City Council had \"not acted quickly enough\" to remove cladding. Council leader Donna Jones said: \"The delays are not about a lack of money, the delays are about the preparation work that needs to go into a job of this enormity. Ms Jones said the PS10m project to replace the cladding would last \"for the best part of the next year\". She said the council had not removed any cladding from Leamington House because it would have exposed flats to rain and damp. The 600 residents, protected by 24-hour fire marshals, were \"extremely safe\", Ms Jones added.

It is independent of local authority control and funded directly by central government. It will have a longer school day and an extra two weeks on the school year. The school's principal Andy Grace said the academy would have a \"strong emphasis on academic attainment\". Mr Grace said there would be a focus on \"literacy and numeracy\". \"The skills that are needed to to secure these young people a career in the future,\" he added. Adrian Joyce, local secretary for the NASUWT union, said the money given to free schools should be invested in local state schools. \"Free schools are private people putting money into the education system,\" he said. For both sets of children, the parents' socio-economic background was the most significant factor. There is considerable difference between regions at GCSE. Identifying the cause of the variation is difficult. However, funding for that was cut in 2010, and the improvement in grades has continued. \"Teach First\" - the scheme which puts graduates from leading universities into schools - also initially helped schools in London and the major cities, but it has been moving into other areas. The influx of immigrants to London and other centres is also a factor. In West Hull a new school - the Boulevard Academy - is trying to do just that. The principal, Andy Grace, says parents want a good education for their children: they just don't know how to support it. Most pupils arrive, aged 11, with a reading level several years below their age. A special curriculum develops their literacy skills. There is an extended school day, shorter summer holiday and Saturday school. Most importantly, according to Mr Grace, is the relationship he builds with parents. Before a pupil starts, he will have met each family nine times: emphasising the importance of school rules, attendance and punctuality. Homework isn't part of that: it is done at school. Children can't guarantee that they will be able to make themselves something to eat when they come home, find somewhere quiet, go on the internet or receive help from their parents. The children I spoke to were positive about the school and the parents were passionate about it, saying it had given their children confidence and a love of learning. None of them had succeeded at school and felt the teachers had written them off. He said: \"Although I was trying to push myself, the help from the teachers wasn't there. By the time I finished my education I just wanted to be outside, so I became a labourer\". Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, is launching a cross-party commission with the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock and Conservative MP Suella Fernandes to investigate why the regional inequalities exist and how they can be addressed.

This gives clinicians a better idea of whether patients need to have surgery. In the later stages of cataract formation, patients commonly experience cloudy vision prior to treatment. Heriot-Watt has been working with Edinburgh Biosciences Ltd and experts from Edinburgh University and organisations in Sweden and Denmark to develop the LED technique. It allows clinicians to monitor a florescence signal from proteins in the eye lens and document changes during cataract formation. Specialised cells in locations like our brain or pancreas create the helpful chemicals and transport them to the surface in tiny bubble-like structures called vesicles. When they arrive at the cell surface, they still move towards certain points but the tracks cannot be seen. The team established why: the tracks are not there. It has taken seven years of intensive research. Happily, there was a mathematician in the house. The \"guy from maths\" was Prof Gabriel Lord. Dr Ali Dun manages ESRIC and did her PhD work on the vesicle project. \"And we have some really amazing microscopes. Some of the images are things of beauty in their own right. Wrangling with the huge amounts of data and building a computer model of how the cells get their precious payloads to where they are needed was where the mathematics came in. Prof Duncan warns that it typically takes years to bring new medicines to patients but he says there are implications for new treatments.. \"If you have diabetes or certain neurological conditions, for example, something has probably gone wrong with the movement of the cargo in these vesicles inside your cells - and we really don't know what. For Prof Lord, the mathematical modelling approach may lead far beyond biology. The work is a prime example of how collaboration between scientific disciplines is amplifying what we can discover. It was funded through the Next Generation Optical Microscopy Initiative led by the Medical Research Council. The mathematicians used the data to look closer still. Scotland's most powerful microscope has been unveiled. It can see things 10 times smaller than previous light-based microscopes. The microscope does it by breaking the limit for light. The problem is known as the diffraction limit of light microscopy. On a computer screen Esric's manager Dr Ali Dun is running an animation of a paramecium, a single-celled organism that eats bacteria. With Sted, life scientists can examine cells in action. That could open new avenues in diabetes research. Better treatments and perhaps even prevention may be possible. But its potential goes beyond life sciences. Materials scientists are already using it to look at new plastics.

His lab designed the computer games Guitar Hero and Rock Band and he himself has developed what he calls \"hyperinstruments\" - real instruments that can measure and improve your performance. \"All technology has a place, and if it's used for artistry, if the sound is beautiful, I'm all for it,\" he said. The Musician's Union is supportive of this sort of digital facilitation, with general secretary John Smith describing it as \"a positive development for the promotion of creativity\". But it has not always been universally popular. \"In general, 10-15 years ago when our group started this work, many people looked down on it,\" said Prof Machover. \"It's a big frontier - not just how to allow technology to bend to our creativity, we need it to be aware of the differences in us, what we bring individually. Fast forward to today and technology abounds. Auto-Tuning, a technique for digitally correcting off-key vocals, is a favourite of plenty of popstars - and even used by hip hop and rap artists as a sound in itself. Opera singers are also often magnified to improve the acoustics in large concert venues. The danger is that people are so surrounded by artificial sounds that live performance is under threat, Tod Machover warns. \"I feel sorry for the younger generation of live artists,\" he told BBC News. \"They are judged by the incredible perfection we hear on recordings. The Musicians' Union does not share this concern. \"Technological advances will never take the place of the thrill of live music events,\" said John Smith. Professor Machover cites 1980s band Milli Vanilli, whose two band members turned out to be neither the musicians nor even the singers behind the music, as \"a bad extreme\" of where technology can take music lovers. \"There has to be a truth in technology, you have to let people know what role it's playing,\" he said. In Professor Machover's view, music tricks with a distinctly artificial feel may have had their day. It's something he himself has moved towards with his current production, an opera called Death and the Powers. \"There's a strong movement towards using technology to enhance the delicacy - something more refined, softer, physical,\" he said of the creation. Imagine collaborating with a classical composer to create a symphony about your hometown. The people of Toronto, Canada, have done exactly that. On Saturday 9 March, residents were treated to a ground-breaking concert that was the result of an almost year-long project. Contributions were invited via the internet and the audience were even able to manipulate the ending of the music via an app. Composer Tod Machover, who is also a technologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Peter Oundjian, the music director at the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, explain how the innovative idea worked. Edinburgh is about to host the first performance of Festival City - Europe's first symphony to be composed using crowdsourced sounds and arrangements suggested by the public via specially-created computer apps. The two men previously worked on a similar project for Toronto. The BBC was given exclusive access to the rehearsals.\n","Lengtg after cut: 757\n","\n","Ghassan Khatib\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 749\n","is a Palestinian politician.\n","The Palestinian Authority has called on President Barack Obama to end tax breaks on American donations to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

Condemning the photos, another army spokesman, Barak Raz, said they did not \"reflect the spirit of the IDF, our ethical standard to which we all aspire\". Capt Shalicar said that one of the aims of the IDF was educational, teaching young conscripts what was right and wrong. Palestinian negotiators have threatened to walk out of the recently resumed direct peace talks with Israel unless the construction freeze is reinstated. Earlier this month, Mr Netanyahu offered to renew the freeze if the Palestinians recognised Israel as a Jewish state, but the Palestinian leadership dismissed the proposal as unfair and unnecessary. Washington has announced that it has abandoned efforts to persuade Israel to renew its settlement freeze. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas says peace talks are now in crisis. Parliamentary elections were cancelled in 2010 and are now over a year late. But the fact is they overwhelmingly blame Israel's long military occupation for their problems. Fatah politicians have called for a \"Palestinian day of rage\" to take place this Friday on the West Bank against the Israeli occupation and the US decision to veto a UN Security Council resolution criticising Israeli settlement expansion on the West Bank. President Abbas then backtracked and said elections couldn't take place without Hamas. This does remind us why Canadian Armed Forces personnel have been deployed to Afghanistan.

EUROPE UK Prime Minister David Cameron The news that Osama Bin Laden is dead will bring great relief to people across the world. Terror was brought to many countries on his direct orders and in his name, against men, women and children, Christians and Muslims. Spanish government The government considers the death of Osama Bin Laden... to be a decisive step in the fight against international terrorism. Retribution inevitably reaches all terrorists. The Egyptian government does not have a comment. We shouldn't fall victim to believe that they are immune. Palestinian Authority spokesman Ghassan Khatib Getting rid of Bin Laden is good for the cause of peace worldwide but what counts is to overcome the discourse and the methods - the violent methods - that were created and encouraged by Bin Laden and others in the world. It remained in place until 1994 when the Oslo Accords came into effect. They were then given an exit permit which was valid for three years. \"We knew about this phenomenon for many years, but this is the first time that we got these incredible figures, referring to 140,000 Palestinians who had their citizenship revoked so we can see how widespread it was,\" says Ido Blum, head of the legal team at HaMoked, Centre for the Defence of the Individual. \"I returned with her in 1994 and she was given a visa which expired after a few months.

He said the additional PS1.3m would \"potentially result in further closures and reductions in police officer numbers\". \"However I have grave concerns about some elements of the current police reform agenda especially the election of Police and Crime Commissioners in six months time.

PM David Cameron said the move would make the police more open and diverse. \"I hope it will improve diversity among senior policing,\" he said. BBC Wales' Gavin Thomas spoke to Siddharth Kara. Ch Supt Gavin Thomas, vice president of the Police Superintendents Association, told BBC Radio 5 live that his immediate reaction to the figures was \"disappointment\", but said cuts to the police force were not helping the situation. The intention was that the new body, with offices across England and Wales, would bring more rigour, transparency and independence to the system for investigating allegations of police wrongdoing after failings were exposed during the Macpherson inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Nevertheless, there are echoes of that case in the flawed IPCC investigation into the death of Sean Rigg in south London in 2008. The IPCC conducted a new investigation and last week, a police sergeant involved in the case was charged with perjury in relation to evidence he gave at the inquest. But the perception that it is the \"police investigating the police\" means that the IPCC has to limit the number of former police officers it can take. Of its 306-strong investigative pool, 60% have never worked for the police. \"They're trying to get people from zero to SIO [Senior Investigating Officer] in 15 to 20 weeks - it simply can't be done,\" he says. However, the scans need to be landmarked by the site's users so data can be analysed. A senior police officer has expressed concern about the way forces in England and Wales protect vulnerable people from abuse and exploitation. Gavin Thomas, president of the Police Superintendents Association (PSA), said officers in charge of public protection should be licensed for the role. Crimes such as domestic violence, child abuse and sexual exploitation are usually dealt with by police teams known as Public Protection Units. He added: \"The College of Policing will be given the responsibility to enforce these standards through a system of national accreditation. Birds that have evolved in isolation on remote islands such as the Galapagos and the Hawaiian archipelago have continued to evolve rapidly. Researchers used collections of birds at the Natural History Museum in Hertfordshire and the Manchester Museum to make 3D scans of beaks. RSPCA Insp Gemma Cooper said the cub had been \"lucky\" to survive the blaze. And Dr Thomas and colleagues say this could be used as a blueprint to develop a more guided weapon against BO - a new type of spray or roll-on deodorant containing a substance that would stop the transport protein from functioning. It comes a year after he warned policing faced a \"perfect storm\" due to budget cuts and rising crime. Ch Supt Thomas is also expected to urge the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, and leading officers to take \"difficult and bold\" decisions.

The rhetoric has turned ugly in the run-up to Croatia's second general election in less than 12 months. And memories of the Balkan Wars of the 1990s and World War Two have been stirred up as rivals try to bolster support and distract from domestic problems. The nationalist HDZ, the largest party in the short-lived coalition government that fell apart in June, astonished most Croatians this year with its choice of culture minister. Zlatko Hasanbegovic was a historian who had repeatedly venerated the genocidal, pro-Nazi Ustasha movement which ruled Croatia in World War Two as \"heroes\" and \"martyrs\". Ugly rhetoric has not been limited to parties on the nationalist right. Former Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, leader of the centre-left Social Democratic Party, made a clumsy attempt to curry favour with veterans of the \"Homeland War\" of the 1990s. Mr Milanovic followed this up by saying another neighbour, Bosnia, was full of \"villains\". She says that nationalist sentiment was successfully buried during Croatia's decade-long EU accession process. But stifling debate in that time meant some issues were never properly debated. \"The sense of freedom came the moment Croatia joined the European Union in 2013. There was this sense of relief: now we are free to say what we want. But the collapse of the last government has brought about at least a few changes. The HDZ is running on its own this time, without any of the more extreme nationalist parties. And it has a new leader, Andrej Plenkovic, a former career diplomat who has a reputation as a moderate with little time for nationalist causes. But his junior partners, the Croatian People's Party, are keen to steer him away from populism and back towards the sort of policies enacted during the four years when he was prime minister. \"I was always concerned with our main coalition partner sometimes flying off the handle in different circumstances,\" says Vesna Pusic, who served as foreign minister until January this year. \"If you judge him by what he says there's need for concern occasionally. \"But if you judge him by what he did when we were in government, it's a completely different picture.

Welsh vineyards are now producing around 100,000 bottles of wine a year according to the association that represents them. Wine Trails Wales has also been launched to show the part it can play in the tourism industry. In 2004, Welsh vineyards produced around 30,000 bottles of wine every year. After years of growing, it has only just produced its first wine but that won a silver international equivalent award. Setting up a vineyard is expensive and it takes a long time before the income flows in. This family-run business says the soil and slate of the Welsh terrain produces great tastes if you pick the right grapes. Owner Amanda Stewart-Robson said: \"It's about the varietal [type of grape] that you choose. \"Historically the industry has not had the knowledge in this neck of the woods and there are a few who've pioneered - Ancre Hill, White Castle, Llanerch, and now we're trying it this far west.

It says tests will take place in Puerto Rico, where devices will be distributed from \"food-truck-style stores\". The firm suggests phones with swappable parts will cost less to maintain and be more attractive to consumers who want to customise their devices. But one expert said it remained to be seen whether the device would have mass-market appeal. It has a 3G modem and can support antennas. In the video, Google showed a cracked display being clipped out and swapped for a new one.

The E-Fan X programme will first put an electric engine with three jet engines on a BAe 146 aircraft. The firms want to fly a demonstrator version of the plane by 2020, with a commercial application by 2025. The weight of batteries coupled with the weight of equipment to cool electric engines are two limiting factors at present, she said. The turbine powering the generator will run on jet fuel and provide power for the electric engine. Analysis: BBC business reporter Theo Leggett There are several good reasons why Airbus wants to develop electrified planes. Use less fuel and costs should come down. Modern jets aren't nearly as noisy as their predecessors from a couple of decades ago, but they still make quite a racket on landing or takeoff. With some forecasts suggesting the number of large aircraft will double over the next 20 years, they could become a powerful tool for cutting emissions of NOx and CO2. So the potential benefits are clear - but first the technology needs to be proven. That has been one of the driving forces behind the Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens programme. And Wright Electric is aiming to offer an electric-powered commercial flight from London to Paris in 10 years. Israeli firm Eviation says the craft - called Alice - will carry nine passengers for up to 650 miles (1,040km) at 10,000ft (3,000m) at 276mph (440km/h). Alice is an unconventional-looking craft: powered by three rear-facing pusher-propellers, one in the tail and two counter-rotating props at the wingtips to counter the effects of drag. It also has a flat lower fuselage to aid lift. \"You build a craft around your propulsion system. Eviation has already received its first orders. For example, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and Siemens are working on the E-Fan X programme, which will have a two megawatt (2MW) electric motor mounted on a BAE 146 jet. The firm says it should provide fuel savings of at least 30%. \"Electric flying is becoming a reality and we can now foresee a future that is not exclusively dependent on jet fuel,\" says EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren. The big problem with this is that 80% of the aviation industry's emissions come from passenger flights longer than 1,500km - a distance no electric airliner could yet fly.\n","Lengtg after cut: 721\n","\n","Kelly Bell\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 623\n","is an English former glamour model.\n","Brides-to-be have been left without their wedding dresses, despite having paid for them, after a bridal wear firm has suddenly closed.

Sam Mendes and Rob Marshall will return as director and choreographer. The Roundabout Theatre Company production will open on 24 April at the Studio 54 theatre on Broadway. For her screen work, the 32-year-old actress has received Oscar nominations for her roles in Brokeback Mountain, Blue Valentine and My Week With Marilyn. Set in Berlin on the brink of World War II, Cabaret centres on the indulgent Kit Kat Klub. It originally opened on Broadway in 1966 with songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb. The Broadway show and the 1972 film starring Minnelli, Joel Grey and Michael York, are based on the 1951 Broadway play, I Am a Camera, which, in turn, was based on Christopher Isherwood's book, Goodbye to Berlin. Other actresses to have played Bowles include Jill Haworth, Gina Gershon, Natasha Richardson, Alyson Reed and Judi Dench.

Partly because he is Belgian, we wanted a warm look - a lot more French and Belgian Art Deco, richer and more striking. Those close to the show note that the look in the earlier series was technically not Art Deco. \"We tried not to be anachronistic,\" producer Brian Eastman said in a recent interview. The flat was both luxurious and a reflection of Poirot's personality. \"Everything in it has to reflect Poirot's obsession. The furniture is square because he hated curves. For the last five years, fan Eirik Dragsund has been painstakingly rewatching the series for his blog. \"There is a clock on the mantelpiece [with what looks like a silver fox or dog on top],\" Dragsund notes.

Journalists aren't allowed to give away any plot details of Pitch Perfect 3 until next week - but you can basically expect all the usual hallmarks of the franchise - along with more cameos from some major music stars. \"It's funny because even after the second one we were awaiting the call for the third and trying to figure out where it was that they were going.

Pitch Perfect 3 begins with a rendition of Britney Spears' song Toxic, which is exactly how some critics found it. Yet other reviewers found plenty to love in the third instalment of the hugely popular franchise. Its plot sees Beca (Kendrick), Fat Amy (Wilson) and Aubrey (Anna Camp) reunite with the rest of the group for a tour of US military bases in Europe. Here's a breakdown of the reviews so far, starting with the positive ones. \"The comedy rarely falters,\" writes Steve Rose, going on to praise the film's \"choice one-liners... music-industry satire\" and Wilson's \"offbeat interjections\". Variety agrees, saying the franchise - expected to conclude with this instalment - \"goes out on a winning note\". Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt praises the cast's \" nutty charisma \", while The List's Katherine McLaughlin says the film delivers \" cheesy and diverting fun \". Den Of Geek's critic, meanwhile, says it is \"a satisfying end to a very fun set of films\" and calls Wilson \"ridiculous, hilarious and incredibly watchable\". Empire's Helen O'Hara is also scathing, calling the film \"a tired retread\" that is \"coasting on fumes\" and which \"only truly comes alive in its performance scenes\". \"Even before the end credits show glimpses of a whole lot of scenes that never appear in the finished cut, you'll have the suspicion that director Trish Sie... ran into trouble somewhere,\" she writes. \"Pitch Perfect 3 is a monumental disappointment,\" he writes.\n","Lengtg after cut: 844\n","\n","Sarah Gordy\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 795\n","is a British actress who has Down syndrome.

The show was revived in 2010, where the first episode drew 8.8 million viewers. The original series was broadcast on ITV from 1971 to 1975 with five series' consisting of 68 episodes. \"It was made by a tremendous team and I can't praise them enough. Talking about her 32-year-old daughter, she says: \"At 5ft tall, Ashley is shorter than most women. In Ohio, Karen Bowersox runs Down's Designs, a company which makes jeans and fashionable trousers for kids and adults with the syndrome. Some, she says, are \"relegated to wearing sweat pants\". Bowersox strongly believes that dressing independently instils confidence. Tops for wheelchair-users are available with bigger-than-usual arm holes for more freedom when self-propelling, and for women, there's a lot of detail high up on the garments to draw attention away from the legs and towards the bust line. She also has small feet so onesies that fit her torso flap around her legs and feet. Another mum, Jane Gordy, whose daughter is Sarah Gordy, an actress with Down's syndrome who has appeared in BBC TV's Call the Midwife, dismisses the idea that people with Down's have shapes which aren't catered for. Not everyone has the energy to put in lots of time towards staying in good shape and it is recognised by many that it is more of a challenge for people with learning difficulties. More than 72,000 people follow Bowersox's Facebook page and she has shipped her jeans to eight countries. She deals with each order personally, which is time-consuming. Fewer than two in 10 people with learning disabilities are in employment. \"I have a friend with [Down's syndrome] who actually pays someone PS40 just so they can do his gardening [for him],\" says Kate Brackley. Some are desperate to gain experience of work - though the story of Ms Brackley's friend is not a practice Mencap had previously come across. \"We try and show them this is what people with a learning disability can do, and this is how easy it is for them to get them in things like employment,\" she says. \"The public don't know about Down's syndrome,\" she explains, adding that some people even seem scared of those with the condition. \"Luckily I got the courage to speak out,\" she adds, saying being employed made her feel \"worthwhile\". She recognises though that many others will not react in the same way. Watch Victoria Derbyshire weekdays from 09:15-11:00 BST on BBC Two and BBC News Channel. England's first Disability Pride festival is taking place in Brighton. It was the brainchild of Jenny Skelton who has three adopted children, all with special needs. Ms Skelton said was inspired to raise awareness about disabilities following an incident at a pub in which she said she and her daughter, Charlie, were asked to leave. Her daughter, who has severe learning difficulties and chromosome abnormalities, become startled by a loud noise and crouched temporarily under a table. The event also saw another actress, Sarah Gordy, become the first woman with Down's syndrome to be made an MBE. \"As far as I was concerned Sarah was going to have every experience there is and if she wants to do something, just do it,\" she said.

But death certificate mentions, which rely on the judgement of doctors, suggest the UK was actually close to 50,000 deaths by the end of May. Whichever way you look at it, the UK has certainly been among the worst affected countries. Just last year a review was suggesting the UK was one of the best prepared countries for a pandemic. The Facebook group Us for Them Scotland, supporting the full-time return of children to school, has gone from 40 members to 6,000 in a week, piling pressure on the government to rethink.

The BBC has been told that NHS England's medical director Stephen Powis informed Sage as early as 13 March that projections predicted the NHS would not have capacity to cope under a strategy which looked only to mitigate the spread of the virus and not suppress it. There is much better availability of PPE now than there was in the early days and although regular testing of staff and residents has been slow to roll out it is a world away from the situation earlier in the year when testing stopped once a home had five confirmed cases. Added to that, from the perspective of ministers, this could never only be about scientific advice. But it is not just between politicians and scientists that disputes have developed. In response to a tweet asking if current hygiene advice was adequate, he replied: \"From what we know so far, it appears that the mutations may allow it to bind to cells and gain entry more easily when we come into contact with it.

Comedy historian Louis Barfe described Mr Shand as the writer of \"great, effervescent lines\". \"He liked a quiet life but at the same time once he was in company he twinkled and sparkled,\" he said. In a Twitter post, Dave Lee who organised the Hull talk described Mr Shand as a \"huge talent\". Born in Luton, Mr Shand started work as journalist on a local newspaper before making a move to Fleet Street reporting for the Daily Express and the Daily Sketch.

He is the chairman of the Swiss-based luxury-goods company Richemont and the South Africa-based company Remgro.\n","Swiss luxury goods group Richemont, owner of the Cartier and Montblanc brands, has announced a better-than-expected increase in sales, driven by greater consumer demand from Asia. While Europe is still the group's biggest market, sales in Asia were up 57% from the same period last year. However, the firm warned that that the fourth quarter would be tougher. Chief executive Johann Rupert warned that it would be \"more challenging\" for the firm to meet such expectations at the end of the financial year, with concerns over the effect of the strong Swiss franc. Richemont is the world's second largest luxury goods group, behind French rival LVMH group. Richemont, the owners of Cartier, saw sales fall 4% during the crucial gift-giving October to December months. The world's second-biggest luxury goods group has been hit by the economic slowdown in Asia and in Europe. Sales were down 9% in Asia and 3% in Europe. Overall, they fell 4% to EUR2.9bn (PS2.2bn; $3.2bn). Richemont, which owns global brands such as Montblanc, Van Cleef & Arpels and Piaget, has also been hit by currency fluctuations. The Geneva-listed company, owned by South African businessman Johann Rupert, said sales were below expectations. Asia has in recent years been the driver for many in the luxury goods market. Sales of luxury watches, in particular, had been hit. Terror attacks across Europe had kept shoppers and tourists away. Paris was particularly affected following the attacks in November. Banking giant HSBC has become the latest high profile company to sever ties with troubled public relations business Bell Pottinger. On Tuesday a major Bell Pottinger investor walked away from the firm and scrapped a plan to sell its 27% stake. Chime, which counts WPP as a big investor, wrote off the stake's value. HSBC said it had used Bell Pottinger for specific projects but would no longer do so. Luxury goods firm Richemont, whose chairman Johann Rupert is South African, stopped dealing with Bell Pottinger earlier this year, as did the Investec investment bank. The Financial Times has reported that Bell Pottinger has hired the accountancy firm BDO to advise on a potential sale. However, a BDO spokesman declined to comment. Lord Bell, who founded Bell Pottinger in the 1990s, resigned last year, partly due to his unease with the company's deal with the Guptas. Industry insiders say the outlook for the firm is cloudy. He said the company had many prominent clients and rival PR firms will see the scandal as an opportunity to win that business. Bell Pottinger did not coin the term, but it is accused of using in a cynical way to stir up racial tension and divert attention from allegations that the government was unduly influenced by the Gupta brothers. And like all good disinformation campaigns, it has an element of truth in it. South Africa is still a deeply divided society, both in terms of income and race. Earlier this year, government data found that whites still earn five times more than blacks. Most South Africans know there is an inequality problem combined with an underlying racial tension.

I was a single guy in New York when USA Today was launched and I quickly figured out their boomer thing. For an American, there is something quite dangerous in lumping everyone born between 1946 and 1960 together - and it is not just evidenced by the maniacal, anonymous postings on newspaper comment threads. Our politics are sundered by arguments that can be traced back to those times. And the decision was made to take the president back to the White House - the safest place in Washington. And this, believes Del Quentin Wilber, who has written a minute-by-minute chronicle of the day, is what lifted Reagan's presidency out of the mere normal. It's through the genuine moments that the public experiences with the leader. However, the BBC has spoken to a source who, in 1981, was working at Bio-Science Laboratories in Maryland, which is cited by the seller as the facility which conducted the tests. Since the trial he has been committed to a Washington DC psychiatric hospital, but has been allowed to spend limited time at his mother's home. In a statement, the Metropolitan police said that Mr Brady's remains were transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for the Northern District of Virginia. Mr Brady died on Monday at the age of 73. A Secret Service agent and a police officer suffered lesser wounds. Photos and video of the incident show the wounded press secretary sprawled on the ground as Secret Service agents rushed the president into his vehicle and others wrestled Hinckley to the ground. He lobbied for legislation to require background checks for handgun sales. The so-called Brady Bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993. On 30 March 1981, Hinckley opened fire on the president's party outside the Washington DC Hilton Hotel, striking four people, including Brady and Reagan. Mr Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity but was sent for treatment to a Washington hospital. Mr Hinckley's lawyer, Barry Levine, told a federal court on Wednesday that the would-be assassin is \"clinically ready\" to leave St Elizabeth's Hospital permanently because he has been in \"full and stable remission\" for more than two decades. His lawyer, Barry Levine, says he's changed dramatically since the assassination attempt and no longer needs to be held at St Elizabeths. \"It seems like this is a political issue more than a psychological issue,\" he says. John Hinckley Jr, the man who tried to assassinate US President Ronald Reagan, is to be released from a psychiatric hospital next month after 35 years. Two law enforcement officers suffered less serious injuries in the shooting. Brooker, a creator and main writer of the anthology series that explores anxiety and human relationships around technology, apologised in 2004 after writing a satirical article for The Guardian on George W Bush in which he wrote: \"Lee Harvey Oswald, John Hinckley Jr - where are you now that we need you?\". The author hangs out with them and sees how devastated they are, often by the sheer volume of comments they receive. It wasn't a good comic character, deliberately so. While the writer says he mourns what he describes as \"the debris of 2016, the year you couldn't even be a clown any more without it being creepy,\" he adds that he is \"incredibly optimistic about technology\". John Walker Lindh and hundreds more have been sent to prison for terrorism, treason and other crimes. Some have been sentenced to life in prison without parole. Legally speaking, the matter is straightforward. Since his conviction, the only glimpse we've had of Lindh was in 2012 when he testified in court, wearing a prison uniform and a white prayer cap, as part of a legal challenge against a ban on group prayer.

But filmmaker Demos told Hollywood news site The Wrap: \"We tried to choose what we thought was Kratz's strongest evidence pointing toward Steven's guilt, the things he talked about at his press conferences, the things that were really damning toward Steven. He was wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years for sexual assault. Many think he was set up by law officials in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, who feared they faced a huge financial penalty over the first case.

Steven Avery is still in prison, but he has his own theories... In 2009, Steven Avery alleged in legal documents that his two brothers Earl and Charles both have a history of sexual violence against women, and that they in fact could be guilty of Teresa Halbach's murder. In 1985 he was charged and convicted for sexual assault, false imprisonment and attempted murder. After his release he was then accused and found guilty of murdering a young woman, Teresa Halbach. Dassey, who has learning difficulties, and his uncle Steven Avery were convicted of murdering 25-year-old Teresa Halbach, in 2005.

Ms Wood told her father Appleton had a criminal record for motoring offences. Robert Buckland, MP for Swindon South and member of the Commons Justice Committee, said it was important to debate the \"potential unforeseen circumstances\" of such a law. At Ms Wood's inquest, the coroner backed a call by the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) for partners to have information about violent offenders disclosed to them. The pilot scheme, which will be tried out in four police areas, has been called Clare's Law after Clare Wood who died at the hands of her ex boyfriend who had a record of violence. Her death led to the government announcing year-long trials, beginning this summer, in Greater Manchester, Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire and Gwent allowing people to ask police if a partner has a violent background. The murder of a mother who had reported a \"serious sexual assault\" by her former partner to police is to be investigated by the police watchdog. It coincides with the launch of the Welsh government's Christmas and New Year domestic abuse campaign and also follows the announcement that Clare's Law, which allows people to check whether new partners have a criminal record for domestic abuse, is being expanded to cover all of Wales and England. The scheme allows the police to disclose information on request about a partner's previous history of domestic violence or violent acts. Home Secretary Theresa May told the BBC: \"Clare's Law will give some help to those people who think they have a partner who may be acting in a way which suggests that they are somebody who is violent. The case of Carl Mills who murdered three generations of a family, including his six-month old baby, in a flat fire in 2012 was also referred to the IPCC because the police had been called to the address in Cwmbran, Torfaen, previously. In future, it plans to make more use of screens and video links in court cases. A disclosure scheme which enables people to find out if their partner has a violent past is to be extended across Scotland. If checks show that someone does have a record of abusive behaviour, the police will consider sharing the information with the people \"best placed\" to protect potential victims. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"Domestic abuse is an appalling crime and I am delighted that, as a result of the national rollout of the scheme, people across Scotland who suspect their partner may have a violent past will have the right to ask for information. More than 900 people in Scotland have been warned their partner has an abusive past as a result of the \"Clare's Law\" legislation. Other family members or friends can also ask the police to investigate if they have concerns that a relative or friend is in danger from their partner.

Singh's exploits on the track and field are legendary in India - he won five golds in international athletic championships, broke a 400m record at the 1960 Rome Olympics and was awarded the Helms World Trophy in 1959 for winning 77 of his 80 international races. The director, who grew up with the \"folklore\" of the \"larger-than-life\" sprinter, says his film is not about Singh the athlete, but rather \"the spirit of Milkha, the colours of his life\".

The budget, sought to offset cuts by identifying more than PS1bn in revenue-raising ideas, but opponents have claimed the financial blueprint does not stand up to scrutiny. The Ulster Unionist ministers, Michael McGimpsey and Danny Kennedy voted against the budget, while SDLP minister Alex Attwood abstained. Last week, the DUP finance minister offered Health Minister Michael McGimpsey an additional PS120m over four years. During the debate, Mr Wilson criticised Mr McGimpsey. \"I have said many times that I would welcome all new ideas but sadly nothing realistic has emerged from my loudest critics.

Alan McFarland, of the Ulster Federation of Rambling Clubs, said it was \"fantastic news\" for local walkers and tourists. The federation has had to do its own data crunching up until now. Experienced hill walkers from Northern Ireland are well used to similar Met Office forecasts in their forays to the Lake District or Scotland, and Mr McFarland says they were always a bit jealous of them. \"These forecasts are compiled by specially-trained meteorologists who often spend time in the hills and mountains and know the ins and outs of mountain weather,\" he says. At this time of year, conditions can be much colder and darkness falls earlier. If the forecast looks very poor, Mr McMullan suggests taking a low-level walk. \"The mountains will still be there another day,\" he says, adding that the mountains can be \"absolutely stunning\" when it has been snowing. The second of two joint services of remembrance for soldiers from Ireland who fought and died in World War One has taken place in northern France.

However, on their return, far from finding a country ruled by a 32-county parliament, many were ostracised or remained silent about their experiences and subsequently supported the republican cause.

Four months on from giving birth to her first child, Blake Lively admits she's \"trying to perfect nothing except functioning\".

Yes, we know Blake is married to Ryan Reynolds, but reassuringly even the double whammy of movie stardom doesn't help when you're new parents. \"What our house is like, it's just in complete chaos,\" Blake tells Newsbeat on the phone from Manhattan, with her girl, James, close by. She's says she's bemused at how \"you have a child and just get to leave the hospital\" without being fully educated on how to deal with it.

Blake says breastfeeding has helped, but she's \"not really obsessing\" over losing any more weight right now. As for her latest film choice, The Age of Adaline, Blake says she didn't want to take on the title role at first. \"I wanted to be able to watch it on rainy Sundays for the next 20 years,\" Blake admits. The fantasy romance tells the story of the challenges Adaline faces after an accident somehow makes her 29 forever. \"It was a magical movie that didn't have that super hero push behind it or that Hogwarts push behind it,\" Blake says.

As a disabled woman, Ginny Butcher is roughly 11 times more likely to die from coronavirus than her peers. New figures also suggest almost two-thirds of Covid-19 deaths in the UK have been disabled people. Ginny is a 22-year-old wheelchair user who needs two personal assistants with her at all times. She is at high-risk of coronavirus and is still shielding at home. She has a ventilated tracheotomy and says she's been \"extremely anxious\" during lockdown because there has been \"zero guidance\" on what to do if any of her assistants became ill or had to isolate. She points to the impact of the Coronavirus Act - the emergency legislation the government passed at the beginning of lockdown - which took away significant parts of councils' duty to provide care for disabled people. Critics said it gave councils - who previously had an obligation to provide certain care - the power to \"downgrade\" provisions for disabled and elderly people. \"Disabled women were left wondering how they were going to get out of bed in the morning,\" Ginny says. \"It has been my biggest concern throughout this crisis,\" she says. \"Hardly anything has been done to protect disabled women. Inequalities have been shown to disproportionately affect disabled people. But Chris Hatton, professor of public health and disability at Lancaster University, highlighted two key factors. He says disabled women, and disabled people in general, are also more likely to have other health conditions that can increase their risk of dying from coronavirus. People with learning disabilities are disproportionately likely to be obese, have diabetes, or have kidney disease, he adds. Crucially, he says people with learning disabilities often develop those conditions at a relatively young age, which could explain why the difference in death rates is particularly pronounced when it comes to young disabled women. The second factor, Prof Hatton says, is that disabled people often have their health concerns overlooked and diagnoses are often delayed because new issues are assumed to relate to existing disabilities, rather than a new condition. Those same issues have spilled over into discrimination in coronavirus treatment. People who were highly dependent on others in their daily lives would be the first to be denied intensive care in the event that units became overwhelmed, regardless of whether they were clinically less likely to survive. \"Medical professionals do not listen to disabled women, and often gaslight disabled women into thinking that they are not sick, unwell or in pain,\" Ginny adds. Ginny says more needs to be done and disabled people's organisations agree. \"It feels like there has been a systemic failure to understand and address the needs of disabled people\", says Mike Smith, a former commissioner of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, who is now chief executive of disability charity Real. Leading charity Disability Rights UK agrees. \"We would want to know whether there are things that could have been done differently, such as earlier provision of PPE, earlier provision of testing, speedier diagnosis, access to critical care - as well as tackling increased isolation,\" says the charity's policy manager Fazilet Hadi. The department said the care provisions implemented in the Coronavirus Act are only intended to be used when absolutely necessary and should be temporary.\n","Lengtg after cut: 835\n","\n","Tzeporah Berman\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 719\n","is a Canadian environmental activist, campaigner and writer.\n","A technology that removes carbon dioxide from the air has received significant backing from major fossil fuel companies. British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering has shown that it can extract CO2 in a cost-effective way. The quest for technology for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the air received significant scientific endorsement last year with the publication of the IPCC report on keeping the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C this century. Around the world, a number of companies are racing to develop the technology that can draw down carbon. Swiss company Climeworks is already capturing CO2 and using it to boost vegetable production. With its new funding, the company plans to build its first commercial facilities. These industrial-scale DAC plants could capture up to one million tonnes of CO2 from the air each year. While the CO2 is helping to drive temperatures up around the world, the comparatively low concentrations make it difficult to design efficient machines to remove the gas. Further refinements mean the gas can be purified into a form that can be stored or utilised as a liquid fuel. It then comes into contact with a hydroxide-based chemical solution. Certain hydroxides react with carbon dioxide, reversibly binding to the CO2 molecule. When the CO2 in the air reacts with the liquid, it forms a carbonate mixture. The chalky calcium carbonate pellets are then treated at a high temperature of about 900C, with the pellets decomposing into a CO2 stream and calcium oxide. Finally a Fischer-Tropsch process turns this gas into a synthetic crude oil. \"The fuel that we make has no sulphur in it, it has these nice linear chains which means it burns cleaner than traditional fuel,\" said Dr McCahill. CO2 can also be used to flush out the last remaining deposits of oil in wells that are past their prime. One of the other investors in Carbon Engineering is BHP, best known for its coal mining interests. \"It's a huge concern,\" Tzeporah Berman, international programme director for Stand dot earth, told BBC News. Others are concerned that the development of direct air capture devices may just encourage some people to think that they don't have to personally reduce their carbon footprint. Certainly, the company believes that its machines could become as common as water treatment plants - providing a valuable service, yet hardly noticed by the general public. Right now, it has secured enough money to build a commercial facility and can draw down carbon for less than $100 a tonne. Carbon Engineering says that if governments want to invest in its process they are very welcome to do so. If they're not ready to stump up the cash, the company is happy to take funding from the energy industry as time is so short, and the need for the technology is so great. In Canada, government ministers rarely need high levels of protection. The move comes as environmental campaigners, particularly women, report increasing levels of abuse. Ms McKenna said she would now have extra protection at certain times, but did not give details. Online abuse has been going on since she was elected, she added, but in recent months public confrontations have become worse. She said she had received messages that included sexualised insults and threats against her family. In person she has been called an enemy, a traitor and a \"communist piece of garbage\". Two years ago Canadian Conservative MP Gerry Ritz apologised to Ms McKenna after calling her \"climate Barbie\". As the climate change debate rages, many activists have found themselves the targets of threats and abuse.\n","Lengtg after cut: 719\n","\n","Nick Cullen\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 811\n","is an Australian professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n","From the butchery of Jack the Ripper to the organised crime of the Krays, an ambitious project is under way to map every London murder case since the 19th Century.

Mr Cullen defended the site, saying: \"We don't want to upset people but want to report cases as accurately as possible. \"Equally, it is important that every murder is reported. Other websites map crime levels by area, which has led some to question whether this new tool is necessary. But the website's founders, who are not yet making a profit but admit they \"might do so eventually\", believe Murder Map is useful in many ways. Street gangs If Murder Map develops to a stage at which decades of homicides are plotted, the website could also provide insight into shifts in crime patterns and its producers think this could influence policy makers. Murder Map's producers say they have not found a similar website for any other city. \"If there was, you could make very interesting comparisons,\" Mr Cullen said. This is not the first time Google Maps has been used to map controversial subject matter. London Street Gangs plots what it claims are the names and territories of more than 100 gangs in the capital.

Travel plans are getting under way as Britain begins a run of two double bank holiday weekends. Rail works will affect some routes, and major motorways - including a reopened M1 - are expected to be very busy. About 18m people are expected to use their cars but high fuel prices will mean shorter trips, predicted the AA. Meanwhile the government has issued a \"smog alert\" in England and Wales for ozone and polluting particles PM10s, which can affect people's health. Defra said some people, including those who have asthma, and particularly the elderly, could be affected by the high pollution levels and may notice an impact on their breathing over the Easter weekend. It urged the public to take \"sensible precautions\" like avoiding exercising outside in the afternoon and not making unnecessary short car journeys. For many people, especially in England and Wales, the warm weather is set to continue all weekend. This year's late Easter and the royal wedding, on 29 April, have resulted in some workers having to take only three days' leave next week to get an 11-day break. But BBC transport correspondent Richard Scott said that with Easter coming at the end of the school holidays for many this year, those with children were likely to have already gone away and be returning this weekend. On the roads, a seven-mile stretch of the M1 in north London - which was affected by a fire in a scrapyard last week - has now fully reopened. AA president Edmund King said motorists setting off for the Easter break would feel the squeeze of soaring fuel costs, with average pump prices now more than 135p a litre for petrol and almost 142p for diesel. Network Rail said the 1430 BST service from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston was stuck with passengers onboard for more than four hours.

Within minutes, state TV said two attacks had been carried out by suicide bombers driving vehicles packed with explosives against the General Security Directorate and another branch of the security services in the upmarket Kfar Sousa district, south-west of the city centre. Video footage was broadcast of heavily damaged buildings, with rescue workers combing through burnt buildings and blood-stained debris, and ambulances taking the injured away. With a solid security presence, Damascus has largely escaped the violence and protests that have flared in central and northern provinces, although there have been protests in suburbs. On Friday, the UN Security Council issued a statement condemning the twin bombings, which targeted two security service bases in Damascus' Kafr Sousa area. The US state department condemned the blasts in Damascus but said they should not deter the Arab League observers from doing their work. It is a claim that is impossible to verify.

Unusually for a crime drama, there are no car chases, shoot-outs, explosions, kidnappings or violent attacks in Netflix's Criminal. The series is set almost entirely in a police interview room, where suspects (played by a guest cast including David Tennant and Hayley Atwell) are interrogated as detectives try to ascertain their guilt or innocence.

The busy, bustling backgrounds helped keep viewers engaged during scenes where the characters were sometimes discussing the more mundane elements of government legislation. But when you're confining your storyline to a single location, there are limited tactics a writer and director can employ.

Australian actress Cornelia Frances has died following a battle with cancer, local media have reported. She had endured a series of health struggles in recent times after being diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2017. Her death was announced on Home and Away's local broadcaster, Seven Network, on Tuesday. Her co-stars and other Australian celebrities have been paying tribute on social media. Frances studied acting in London but she gained fame after moving to Australia in 1970. In a career spanning decades, she starred in popular local soaps and dramas including The Young Doctors, Prisoner, and Sons and Daughters. On Home and Away, she played Morag - the famously scheming sister of Ray Meagher's Alf Stewart - in various stints from 1988 until last year. \"I've always played the strong ladies,\" she told the local Nine Network earlier this year. \"I'm going to fight it [the cancer], by God I am. [Acting] has been a wonderful road and I've loved every minute of it. In an interview in January, Frances revealed that she had also suffered a recent hip bone fracture and an ulcer in her throat. The Seven Network described Frances as a unique actress. \"Her on screen presence inspired a generation of actors. This gift was coupled with an ability to bring a sense of dignity and presence into each room she entered,\" it said in a statement. Meagher said: \"Cornie was an incredibly loved and valued member of our cast over many, many years. Australian media reported that she is survived by her son, Lawrence.

The festival, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, is being celebrated in India on Tuesday. Most of of the bazaars in Indian cities and towns were busy last night as people rushed to buy food and new clothes to prepare for the celebrations, reports say. \"Special prayers, family get-togethers and a lavish spread of biryani [traditional dish of meat and rice], sheer khurma [dessert] and saalan [curry] marks the celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr,\" says a report in The Times of India.

The Indian agriculture minister has said his government is supporting \"yogic\" farming to \"empower seeds with the help of positive thinking\". Radha Mohan Singh said it would help improve yield and soil fertility and contribute to making India prosperous. More than 50% of India's population depends on agriculture for a living. But farming in India has been going through a crisis in recent years with thousands of farmers killing themselves in despair over poor harvests. The minister's comments follow earlier controversial statements - in July, he was criticised for his bizarre comments that farmer suicides were a result of \"failed love affairs\" and \"impotency\". \"Such exercise is accepted by my ministry essentially to enhance Indian farmers' confidence. Indian farmers have, over the years, lost confidence in the age-tested knowledge of farming,\" the minister was quoted by The Indian Express as saying. Mr Singh is part of India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is accused by the critics of trying to promote traditional beliefs even when they are not backed by scientific evidence.

Earlier this year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi led 35,000 people in a mass yoga programme in the capital, Delhi, in an attempt to set a world record.

However, in the land of Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, John Newcombe, Pat Cash, Margaret Court and Evonne Goolagong Cawley, that simply is not good enough. Between the early 1950s and the early 1970s, Australian men won 14 out of 20 Wimbledon singles titles. In this golden era, the country won 15 Davis Cups. Alas, these days most Australian players do not even reach the second week of grand slam tournaments let alone the final. Now at least Australian tennis fans have a new star to root for: 18-year-old Bernard Tomic, who has become the youngest men's player since Boris Becker to reach the quarter-finals of Wimbledon. For Australia's gloom-laden tennis fans, that day cannot come soon enough. The former world number one had already announced his retirement at a press conference prior to his second-round match against the promising Australian player Bernard Tomic. Furthermore, it transpired he had told his compatriot Serena Williams of his decision to retire late last year. Few people who wear those clothes today are aware of the tennis history associated with the brand. Although mostly remembered for his confrontational on-court behaviour, which frequently landed him in trouble with umpires and tennis authorities, he became a respected figure in the media after he retired from tennis, while his interest in art led him to open a gallery in New York City which features up-and-coming young artists. Some UK players took the media route a step further. The London hospital which employed a nurse caught up in a hoax call about details of the Duchess of Cambridge has protested to the Australian network which broadcast the conversation. The Sydney station, 2Day FM, is owned by Southern Cross Austereo. The DJs, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, impersonated the Queen and the Prince of Wales, and their call was put through by duty nurse Mrs Saldanha to the duchess's nurse who then unwittingly revealed details of her medical condition. He said he hoped the station \"has undertaken to never again attempt to jeopardise their professional standing by perpetrating such a deception against another hardworking nurse or midwife\". \"Due to unforeseen circumstances, the specialist team have been unable to facilitate the build and, despite extensively investigating all alternative options, we have not been able to secure a solution. \"Vigoro\" saw teams of between eight and 11 players performing like cricketers - bowling, batting and fielding - but using racquets. Batsmen had to run if they made contact with it, speeding things up. \"At that time cricket, along with football, was seen as the sport,\" says Elizabeth Wilson, author of the Love Game: A History of Tennis, from Victorian Pastime to Global Phenomenon. \"Tennis was perceived to be more effeminate, more of a social event. In October 1902, a match took place at Lord's. Grant tried to end the confusion by making Vigoro more explicitly like cricket. Grant's ambition, whether fired by a pure love of Vigoro or an awareness of its commercial possibilities, was undimmed. By the 1920s Vigoro had lost any association with tennis, apart from the roundedness of the bats. Indeed, this aspect of its history was airbrushed from The Laws of Vigoro, which described it as a \"combination of cricket and baseball\". In 1923 he wrote to the socialite and women's rights activist Alva Belmont, asking for her help to secure demonstrations of Vigoro in New York department stores and promising to create a \"tremendous sensation\". Vigoro has been likened in its speed to T20 cricket, now the most commercially successful form of the game. \"The time is right for Vigoro to revisit England, its mother country,\" says Karena Walsh, of the New South Wales Vigoro Association.

Most of the editorials and commentaries wrote in support of China's sovereignty over the islands, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan, but lambasted protesters for violence. Meanwhile, The Beijing Times and Ming Pao Daily News said that around 1,000 fishing boats from Zhejiang and Fujian province had set sail for the disputed islands as the summer fishing moratorium for the East China Sea ended.

As United States troops prepare to leave Afghanistan in 2014, a major regional shift is underway. China has already secured some oil and copper mining concessions. Until now, China has carried out few development projects in Afghanistan and is unlikely to help fund the country's army and police, as the US would like. But all that could change once the Americans leave. Moscow sent its special representative and long-time regional expert Zamir Kabulov to Islamabad to suss out what the Pakistanis want and offer economic help, such as refurbishing Pakistan's one and only steel mill, built with Russian help in the 1970s. He pleased the government by echoing Pakistan's refrain that the world should recognize Pakistan's ''huge sacrifices'' in the war on terror and help safeguard its sovereignty, rather than question Pakistan's intentions as the US has done recently. Talks with the US on the issue have so far failed. Beijing is worried that any threat to Pakistan from internal insurgency or secessionist movements would only bolster its regional rival India. So, for the first time ever China has held high-level discussions with US officials that have focused on the crisis in Pakistan and how both countries could nudge Pakistani leaders to do the right thing. Nevertheless, a shift in the tectonic plates in the region is taking place. Pakistan and Afghanistan can either take quick advantage of these changes or revert back into chaos. Gen Curtis Scaparrotti told lawmakers in Washington on Thursday that Moscow was \"perhaps\" supplying the extremist group. Moscow considers the Taliban a terrorist organisation, and backed the Northern Alliance against the group in the civil war of the 1990s. Softening its approach towards the Afghan Taliban is a dramatic and somewhat unexpected shift for Russia. Meanwhile, Afghan officials have repeatedly reminded Moscow that instead of establishing links with non-state actors, it should work with the government for regional peace and stability. But Mr Kabulov told RIA Novosti state news agency on Friday: \"These fabrications are designed, as we have repeatedly underlined, to justify the failure of the US military and politicians in the Afghan campaign. The US accuses Russia of trying to destabilise Afghanistan by supporting the Taliban. Senior US officials have been saying for months that Moscow is even supplying the militants with weapons. But a number of US and Nato officials have been more cautious. Moscow and the Taliban deny the US claims that they are working together. The Russian embassy in Kabul and the foreign ministry in Moscow dismissed such claims as \"baseless\" and \"idle gossip\". A Taliban spokesman said they had not \"received military assistance from any country\". Moscow has repeatedly accused the US and Nato of trying to blame Russia for their \"failures\" and worsening security in Afghanistan. Russia denies materially supporting the insurgents but acknowledges \"contacts\" with the Taliban. Almost all founding members of the Taliban movement were part of the mujahideen, which fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. There are three major reasons for Russia-Taliban links. At least two Russians were captured by the Afghan Taliban on two separate occasions, in 2013 and 2016, when their helicopters crashed in Taliban-controlled areas. Both were released after lengthy negotiations. This comes at a time when US-Russian relations are at a low point and the geopolitical situation is changing fast.

Mr Corbyn said this should be funded by higher charges for parents who send their children to private school - and Labour quoted an estimate from the Fabian Society that VAT on private school fees could raise about PS1.5bn per year. Angela Rayner, shadow education secretary, told the Today programme this move would stop young people being \"saddled with debt\". A promised PS1.3bn boost for schools in England has been criticised by Labour, as the money has been taken from other budgets in the Education department. A council leader who died after collapsing while delivering Christmas cards was \"my mentor and friend\", MP Angela Rayner has said. Ahead of her party's manifesto launch, Angela Rayner told BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty the plan is about \"building communities again\". In 2017, it promised 100,000 council or housing association homes a year. Asked if he took responsibility for the instability in politics in the years since the referendum, Mr Jenrick said he wished \"we had managed to get Brexit done a long time ago\", claiming that Parliament had blocked the process. Rebecca Long Bailey has confirmed she is considering standing in the contest to be Labour's next leader, pledging to champion \"progressive patriotism\". So far, only Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis have officially entered the race to replace Mr Corbyn, though a number of others - including former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper, party chairman Ian Lavery and Sheffield City Region mayor Dan Jarvis - have said they are thinking about standing Labour's dire election performance has prompted a debate about the future direction of the party and how it can return to power. The lawyer, who led the Crown Prosecution Service before entering politics, argued that he was best equipped to unite different wings of the party after years of internal infighting. Ms Rayner says she wants to \"rebuild\" the Labour movement over the next five years. Conservative MPs have launched a taskforce to \"spearhead\" government efforts to reduce regional inequality. Ms Milling, in a letter signed by more than 100 Tory backbenchers, wrote that Ms Rayner's use of the word \"scum\" towards Mr Clarkson was \"unacceptable\". Mr Corbyn's legal team also asked for minutes of a Zoom meeting on 12 November between the two sides, as well as any communications between Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge or Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and Sir Keir. It is understood the Conservative Chief Whip, Mark Spencer, will speak to the MP and ask him to attend a meeting with scientific advisers. Teachers are more at risk of infection and death from coronavirus, Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner has suggested, as she called for them to be vaccinated during February half term. School workers had moderate exposure to disease, with primary and nursery teachers more exposed than secondary. Since being shown the tweet, the Conservatives said Ms Thomason had been \"suspended from the party and is no longer a member\". In a letter to Ms Nichols, the Tory co-chairman Amanda Milling MP apologised and stated that the party's complaints team was \"looking into all allegations against Warrington Conservatives\".\n","Lengtg after cut: 712\n","\n","Chris Witty\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 769\n","is an American speed skater and racing cyclist and participated in the Olympic Games in both sports.\n","There were 12 days between Steve Walsh leaving a business conference in Singapore and finding out he had been infected with the new coronavirus. When he was tested, he did not even have any symptoms. But the previous two - both Chinese nationals who were in York - had had limited contact with others. The fact doctors have become infected is, in many respects, the \"worst-case scenario\" for health officials as the virus is known to be most risky to the frail and vulnerable. The only silver lining, according to those involved in the hunt for contacts, is they do not seem to have treated that many patients. Those patients and many others now face an anxious wait to find out if they have been infected. Those in the business refer to it as fires and sparks. Each carrier is a fire letting off sparks that may generate other fires. NHS England said extra money was being invested which would help hospitals recruit staff and cut waiting times. It is already widely documented that A&E units have struggled this winter, missing the four-hour target by a record margin. Meanwhile, all hospitals have been asked to set up isolation pods in case patients with the virus go to hospital - the official advice is to phone NHS 111 and self-isolate. There is also a drive to get as many patients as possible who do not need to be there, discharged from hospital. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also put out a call for 250,000 NHS volunteers to deliver food and medicines. It is worth saying, though, that the UK is not alone in this. Hospitals go through 150,000 a day, so it was of limited value. To help, the government has enlisted the help of the army. General Sir Nick Carter, the chief of defence staff, the most senior military commander in the UK, has called it the most \"single greatest logistical challenge\" he has ever experienced - there are over 200 hospitals and 50,000 care homes and other community settings to get deliveries too. A major deal has been agreed with China to supply 25 million gowns - enough for six months. Niall Dickson, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health and care leaders, says front-line staff are still surviving \"hand-to-mouth\" and until a long-term supply can be guaranteed, the issue threatens to undermine the fight to tackle the coronavirus. Data from hospitals in England last week showed more than nine in 10 deaths have been in the over-60s and there is a similar picture in the rest of the UK. The good news from that point of view is that the numbers seem to be coming down. When you look at the deaths by the date they happened, it appears that the peak happened in the first half of April - in England at least. A similar pattern has happened in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The lack of early testing may have masked how widespread the virus was in the UK, says University of Oxford's Prof James Naismith, which resulted in delays announcing the lockdown. The pandemic has also had a knock-on effect on emergency care. It should not come as a surprise that people report finding lockdown difficult. Health visitors have been forced to carry out nearly all their work remotely, either on the phone or via video technology. Other consequences of the pandemic could take even longer to emerge. The alert level, which is recommended by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, was reduced from level 4 to 3 on 19 June - which indicated the virus was \"in general circulation\" but there could be a \"gradual relaxation of restrictions\". Certainly the trajectory of countries like France and Spain is not as sharp as the worst-case scenario put forward. But any restrictions have a cost to society.\n","Lengtg after cut: 769\n","\n","Maxime Bernier\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 1018\n","is a Canadian businessman, lawyer and politician who served as a cabinet minister of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and as Member of Parliament for Beauce from 2006 to 2019. He is the founder and current leader of the People's Party of Canada. Bernier ran for the Conservative Party leadership in the 2017 leadership election, and came in a close second with over 49% of the vote in the 13th round, after leading the eventual winner, Andrew Scheer, in the first 12 rounds. Fifteen months later, in August 2018, Bernier resigned from the Conservative Party to create his own party, citing disagreements with Scheer's leadership. His new party was named the People's Party of Canada in September 2018. Bernier later ran in the by-election for York Centre in October 2020, but lost the race to Ya'ara Saks, having only gained 3.56% of the vote.\n","Businessman and reality TV star Kevin O'Leary has unexpectedly dropped out of the leadership race for Canada's Conservative Party. Mr O'Leary said his US television punditry served Canadian interests. \"I am probably the most known Canadian that's on American television, and I'm going to talk about what we mean to Americans and how we should be considered in trade wars,\" he said. At the party's leadership convention on 27 May. the Conservative Party will face the task of picking Mr Trudeau's challenger in the 2019 election. With 13 candidates, there are no clear front runners and few big names. \"All the candidates say 'I'm the person who can beat Trudeau',\" Peter Woolstencroft, a political scientist at the University of Waterloo, told the BBC. The latter approach may go over well with some, Mr Woolstencroft says, but it would be \"disastrous\" in a general election. He emerged as the winner on the thirteenth ballot in the leadership contest, narrowly defeating his primary rival, former foreign affairs minister Maxime Bernier, with 51% of the vote. \"We all know what it looks like when Conservatives are divided,\" he said. He was replaced on an interim basis by Rona Ambrose, a veteran federal politician who recently announced her retirement from federal politics. The issue arose because one party running in October's election denies climate change is a threat. The UN has called for decisive political action by 2020 to put an end to climate change. But despite critical words, party leaders say they will let court battles launched in Quebec against the bill play out - keeping their hands out of Quebec's affairs. Many who were initially named as part of the exodus said the claim was not true, which led federal Green Party leader Elizabeth May to accuse the federal NDP of using \"strong-arm tactics\" to get those candidates back in the fold. But a new political party in Canada hopes to change that. But Mr Bernier doesn't need to win a government - or even a seat - if he wants to hurt his one-time rival Mr Scheer. This is quite the change for Canada, says Eric Kauffman, who teaches politics at Birkbeck University of London. She also made a direct appeal to voters to cast their ballots for the Greens so they might hold power in a minority situation. The family initially responded by posting an apology on their Facebook page. \"We would like to formally apologise for the unfortunate incident that occurred with the elderly woman,\" said the statement. Both Liberal leader Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer condemned the hate directed at the al-Soufis on Tuesday evening. That's not to say he didn't face any attacks from the other leaders on stage. National opinion polls indicate the two parties remain tied in first place - as they have been since the beginning of the campaign in mid-September. Still, this debate was more subdued than prior ones and the party leaders had brief discussions on some of the key policy issues that have arisen in this campaign. Mr Scheer said a Conservative government \"will evaluate the decision\". Moderator Patrick Roy pressed the leaders on just that, saying: \"We get the impression you're being really cautious not to displease Quebec voters,\" To varying degrees, most the federal leaders have spoken out against the legislation - except the Bloc Quebecois, which supports the bill - while saying they want to respect the jurisdictional rights of Quebec. But these figures put Canada behind both Spain and Norway for net migration per person. When looking at the total numbers of people migrating to Western countries, Canada has seen the 12th highest increase of migrants entering per person during Mr Trudeau's time in office. However, it's not correct to say the country has received more migrants per capita than other Western countries. Although as a devout Roman Catholic he opposes gay marriage and abortion personally, he says he would not bring the issues to a vote if the Conservatives were in power.\n","Lengtg after cut: 977\n","\n","Bashar al-Assad\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 1035\n","is a Syrian politician who has been the 19th president of Syria since 17 July 2000. His father, Hafez al-Assad, was the president of Syria before him, serving from 1971 to 2000. Born and raised in Damascus, Bashar al-Assad graduated from the medical school of Damascus University in 1988 and began to work as a doctor in the Syrian Army. Political scientists have characterised the Assad family's rule of Syria as a personalist dictatorship. On 17 July 2000, Assad became president, succeeding his father, who died in office a month prior. On 16 July 2014, Assad was sworn in for another seven-year term after another non-democratic election gave him 88.7% of the vote. Once seen by many states as a potential reformer, the United States, the European Union and the majority of the Arab League called for Assad's resignation from the presidency in 2011 after he ordered a violent crackdown on Arab Spring protesters, which led to the Syrian Civil War. The OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism concluded in October 2017 that Assad's government was responsible for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. In June 2014, the American Syrian Accountability Project included Assad on a list of war crimes indictments of government officials and rebels it sent to the International Criminal Court. Assad has rejected allegations of war crimes and criticised the American-led intervention in Syria for attempting regime change.\n","When Bashar al-Assad was sworn in as Syria's president on 17 July 2000 following his father Hafez al-Assad's death, few would have bet heavily on the tall, callow-looking young man's chances of still being in the job ten years later. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has told US channel ABC News, that he did not order the military to kill or be brutal in its crackdown on anti-government protesters. President Assad's crackdown on the protests has led to international condemnation and sanctions. In a surprise address to thousands of supporters in Damascus Square Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said he thanked them for backing him in the fight against \"terrorism\" and vowed to defeat, what he claims, is an international conspiracy. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has at least one ally on the UN Security Council: Russia, an ally adamant in its opposition to sanctions against Damascus. The next month, the EU said Gen Hassan was \"involved in the repression against the civilian population\" during the recent anti-government unrest, and imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on him. SES allegedly provided exporters with end-user certificates indicating Syria was the final destination, and then shipped them illegally to Iraq. Joshua Landis of the University of Oklahoma told the New York Times in July 2012 that he was now a key financier and organiser of feared pro-Assad militiamen known as \"shabiha\", who activists say have been used by the government to intensify the crackdown on protesters and commit atrocities on its behalf. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has strongly condemned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, saying ''he has become a war criminal'' after last month's alleged chemical attack near Damascus. In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad talks about the devastating civil war, the use of barrel bombs, the battle against Islamic State and al-Qaeda and relations with the US. Mr Assad's many enemies will dismiss his view of the war. Bashar Assad said he was sure the army could defend the core areas where it was consolidating - meaning Damascus, the cities of Homs and Hama and the coast. The Syrian army has been forced to give up some areas in order to retain others in the war against rebels, now in its fifth year, President Bashar al-Assad has acknowledged. In May 2015, hundreds of IS fighters drove hundreds of kilometres across the desert to reach Palmyra, almost uninterrupted, while government forces were dropping barrel bombs over opposition areas full of civilians. In a deeply unusual move, leaders of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect in Syria have released a document, obtained by the BBC, that distances themselves from his regime and outlines what kind of future they wish for the country after five years of civil war. Speaking on condition of anonymity, two of the leading Syrian Alawites behind the document told the BBC that they were keen to make this statement of identity as many Alawites were being killed because of their faith. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad says reports of a chemical attack by his forces were \"100% fabrication\". President Assad was decorated with the highest class of the award, the grand-croix, in 2001 after he took power following the death of his father. Advertisement The BBC has determined there is enough evidence to be confident that at least 106 chemical attacks have taken place in Syria since September 2013, when the president signed the international Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and agreed to destroy the country's chemical weapons stockpile.\n","Lengtg after cut: 997\n","\n","Jim Webb\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 819\n","is an American politician and author.

In these early months of the US presidential marathon, the so-called \"money race\" - to lock down big donors and amass a hefty campaign war chest - is of particular interest to campaign-watchers and political party operatives. The story is particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton because it plays into two existing negative perceptions about both the former secretary of state and her husband - that they are overly secretive and they believe the normal rules don't apply to them. Legalisation of marijuana was supported by 41% of respondents, for instance. Now the question is whether a crowd like this will pass their support on to Paul's son - and whether the price of that support will put the senator at risk of alienating a larger, more important part of the Republican base.

Last week an open message, signed by over 600 researchers, said the HBP was \"not on course\", demanding a review. An official reply said HBP members were \"saddened\" by the protest and Prof Henry Markram, the project's chair, has labelled it a personal crusade. In a letter to Nature, the six authors call for a more \"open-minded attitude\". Prof Richard Frackowiak, a co-executive director of the HBP, told the BBC he \"strongly objects\" to the idea that the project leaders were dismissive. \"We've taken this extremely seriously,\" he said. The HBP is one of two flagship technology projects (the other being graphene research ) announced in January 2013 by the European Commission (EC). In an open message to the EC, hundreds of neuroscientists last week expressed concern at the narrow scientific focus and closed management style of the project's leaders. Dr Pouget was involved in the HBP before it received the flagship funding but withdrew, along with several colleagues, in 2012. \"It was originally supposed to have a big theory component, but many of us were worried about the increasing focus on simulations,\" he told BBC News. \"We remain a project that is totally open and is building infrastructures for the use of the whole community,\" he said. \"We're going through a process of construction.

Prof Frackowiak does not see the situation as a crisis. The charges against Chaka Fattah, who represents Pennsylvania, include bribery, fraud and money laundering. In one case, he is said to have used cash raised for an election campaign to pay off some of his son's student debt. Mr Fattah, 58, who was first elected in 1994, is one of the most senior black lawmakers in Congress. \"These types of criminal acts betray the public trust and undermine faith in government,\" Mr Memeger added. His office said it would issue a statement later on Wednesday. She said he had \"rightly\" stepped down from his position as the top Democrat on the House subcommittee that oversees justice department spending. His lawyers said the schemes were run without his knowledge by two political consultants who had pleaded guilty. Fattah, from the Democratic Party, will be sentenced on 4 October. Prosecutors also said he disguised a lobbyist's bribe as payment for a car he never sold. Four of his associates were also charged, prosecutors said. The penalty was handed down by a federal judge in Philadelphia, the city that he represented until June 2016. Calling his crimes \"astonishing\", given that Fatah and his TV anchor wife already had a $500,000 annual income, the judge handed down the second-longest prison sentence ever given to a US congressman for corruption. Four of his aides have been found guilty as well, and will be sentenced later this week. Fatah's son, Chaka Fatah Jr, is serving a five-year sentence on bank and tax fraud charges.

One of the more significant hurdles in funding the nets was overcome when the US president signed a law making safety barriers and nets eligible for federal funds. Federal funding will make up $49m of the project. During a news conference on Thursday ahead of the vote, one of the few people who had survived a suicide attempt off the bridge rejected the argument those who were suicidal would find another way if the nets were installed. Kevin Hines, 32, said he felt \"instant regret\" when he jumped. \"Not one more soul, not one more soul will be lost to that bridge,\" he said. A leading mental health campaigner, who survived a jump from San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge, is in Belfast for a two-day suicide awareness conference. Kevin Hines, who is bipolar, attempted to take his life by jumping off the bridge when he was 19. Mr Hines, now a suicide prevention advocate, is one of just 34 people (less than 1%) who survived falling from the bridge. He is addressing a conference organised by counselling charity Contact NI. Mr Hines said the coastguard arrived at the scene quickly, thanks to a motorist who saw him jump in and rang for help, and that was not his only stroke of good fortune. \"I use ten steps every day to stay mentally well - they include things like education into my disease, medication, exercise, proper sleeping and eating habits. On the first day of the conference, Northern Ireland Health Minister Jim Wells said suicide was \"one of the biggest public health and societal challenges that we face\". \"Academics would conservatively estimate that each one of these deaths closely affects another six people.

It was his first post since he received a worldwide backlash for a video he posted showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. It has received a largely positive response from his young fans online. The group appeared to be shocked at their find, but also made jokes. He later apologised and admitted it had been \"misguided\". In response, Paul's channels were removed from YouTube's Google Preferred programme, where brands sell ads on the platform's top 5% of content creators. YouTube also said it had put on hold original projects with the US vlogger. A petition for him to delete his account was signed hundreds of thousands of times. In the new video, Suicide: Be Here Tomorrow, Paul addresses the controversy and admits he had let people down. \"It's time to learn from the past as I get better and grow as a human being,\" he says. He also speaks to Kevin Hines, who survived a suicide attempt from San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge aged only 19. In the video he also shares advice with his fan base about steps they can take to help prevent suicide.

The shoot drew complaints last November for filming war scenes featuring extras in Nazi uniforms on Remembrance Sunday. At the time, Ayer - whose other films include Harsh Times, End of Watch and Sabotage with Arnold Schwarzenegger - expressed his \"heartfelt apologies for any disrespect caused\". Clare Stewart, London Film Festival director, described Fury as \"a resounding cinematic achievement\" that would bring this year's event \"to a monumental close\". The film will go on general release in the UK and Ireland on 24 October. \"The fields of Oxfordshire and Bovingdon Airfield in Hertfordshire were our home for 12 weeks last year, so it's something of a homecoming for us to present the movie at its European premiere,\" said Ayer this week. The 50-year-old was working on Fury at the same time his wife Angelina Jolie was directing her forthcoming WWII film Unbroken, which stars Jack O'Connell as an Olympic athlete taken prisoner by Japanese forces. \"There's nothing ergonomical about a tank,\" Pitt admitted. \"You were always getting banged up on something. \"But we were forced to familiarise ourselves with the tank and we all found our little comfort spots.

Whether she is still in business by the end of 2011 could be one of the indicators of just how serious the Cuban authorities are about encouraging and developing this fledgling private sector. The sixth Cuban Communist Party Congress, the first to be held in 14 years, will take place in late April to discuss and ratify what will be the first major overhaul of the island's Soviet-style economic model since the 1960s.

President Castro has pushed through a series of cabinet changes, promoting many military figures into senior posts. At the moment, though, there are no clear cut younger front runners to take over.

Under the Bush administration such visits were limited to once every three years. That is expected to jump by up to 30% again in the coming year.

Several leading Cuban musicians, including Los Van Van and Silvio Rodriguez, have gone the other way across the Straits of Florida and played to US audiences. But the decades-old trade embargo remains firmly in place. Legislation that would have lifted all restrictions on Americans travelling to Cuba died in December before it could be voted on in Congress. The continued detention of Alan Gross, a US contractor working on a USAID-financed project to promote democratic change on the island, has also soured relations.

And as Nato forces prepare to leave, these arts are being used to reawaken the mythology of the lone warrior. Despite the ban on music and songs while they ruled the country, the militants understood early on that poetry is cherished at the very heart of Afghan culture cutting across ethnic and language boundaries. They believe poetry converted to chants will help them recruit new fighters and inspire existing ones. It provides links to hundreds of chants by dozens of different singers. Taliban-endorsed \"poetry\" or chants, in both the Pashto and Dari languages, are rhythmic, passionate and hypnotic, and mostly without instrumental accompaniment. It commissions, produces and distributes the chants. Such sentiments are likely to strike a chord with many men in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But there is another explanation to the apparent popularity of the taranas. Haji Mahboob, from south-eastern Ghazni province, where the Taliban are prevalent, says they randomly check mobile phones. \"They stopped me once to see what I was playing in my vehicle... They told me to listen to jihadi and religious chants, then I wouldn't be bothered,\" says Niamatullah, a driver from the east of the country.

Holsoe said what made him investigate in the first place was CIA Chief George Tenet publicly saying that satellite images gave no indication the target was an embassy - \"no flags, no seals, no clear markings\" - when in fact all three were present. \"This was, and always will be, a murky story,\" said Sweeney. One former military intelligence officer told the BBC he believed the bombing was intentional and that the CIA's explanation was ludicrous; while another, a retired colonel, said he believed America's story.

The BBC's Umaru Fofana in the capital, Freetown, says final results had been expected on Thursday and there is growing public anxiety about the delay. The head of the World Health Organization and leaders of West African nations affected by the Ebola outbreak are to announce a new $100m (PS59m; 75m euro) response plan. The UN's special envoy for Ebola, David Nabarro, told the BBC that plans were on course to provide 4,000 beds for Ebola patients by next month, compared with 300 at the end of August. Many schools in Liberia have reopened, six months after they were closed to try to curb the spread of Ebola. President Koroma, an insurance broker by profession, has pursued free-market policies and encouraged foreign investment to rebuild the damage caused by the civil war. Sierra Leone's Vice-President Samuel Sam-Sumana has been sacked for seeking political asylum in a foreign embassy, the president's office has said. On Friday, President Ernest Bai Koroma lifted the quarantine on one of the last villages to be cordoned off to help stop the spread of the virus, marking the moment as the beginning of the end of the outbreak in Sierra Leone. But campaigners will need to be careful how they tread, for fear of adding fuel to those who argue that the West is imposing its own moral values on sovereign African states. The diamond, weighing 709 carats, is now locked up in Sierra Leone's central bank in Freetown.

In a statement, the central bank said it would no longer accept Greek government bonds as collateral for lending money to commercial banks. The move makes access to cash more expensive for Greece's banks. In Athens, the stock market fell more than 6%, while bank stocks tumbled as much as 16%. The ECB said that its move was because it could not assume a \"successful\" deal on Greece's EUR240bn (PS179bn) bailout. Shares in Greek banks fell sharply, with Alpha Bank shares were down 10%, Eurobank shares down 15%, and National Bank of Greece 12.3% lower. The wider Athens stock market initially fell more 10% before recovering slightly. Italian and Spanish stock markets were also trading down about 1% by mid-morning. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek bonds rose more than two percentage points as investors demanded higher returns on the country's debt. The newly-elected Greek government is in talks with international creditors over the terms of its bailout, which it thinks are too harsh. The Greek finance ministry said the ECB's decision, which is due to come into effect on 11 February, would have \"no adverse impact\" on the country's financial industry. It said the sector was \"fully protected\", with other options still available. Banks can still access funding through the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) programme, run by Greece's central bank, and at a much higher cost to the banks. According to the Greek newspaper Kathimerini, the interest rate is 1.55%, compared with 0.05% on regular ECB financing. Earlier on Wednesday, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, met the ECB's president Mario Draghi to discuss the country's bailout. Analysts said the ECB statement was a sign the meeting had not been a success. \"This is clearly the ECB signalling to the Greek government: You're going to have to talk to [international lenders] the troika and get a deal,'' Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics told the Associated Press. The euro fell sharply against the dollar on the news, dropping more than a cent to $1.1331. On Thursday, Mr Varoufakis is due to meet his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schaeuble, one of the toughest critics of the new Greek government. The European Central Bank's decision reflects the uncertainty about whether Greece will reach an agreement on its bailout programme with the rest of the Eurozone. Greek government bonds have such a poor credit rating that the ECB only accepts them as collateral if the Government has such a support programme in place. The immediate direct impact on the Greek banks is likely to be relatively moderate. They can use other assets to borrow from the ECB and they can turn to the national central bank - but at a higher interest rate. The move does however add to the pressure on the Greek government to do a deal. Over the next few weeks the banks in Greece could face further stress. Already, significant amounts have been withdrawn from accounts, and there is a possibility of further restrictions on their access to central bank funds. There is now movement in the Brexit talks between the EU and UK but even if a deal is struck there could still be problems on 1 January 2021, Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund has said. He told BBC World News on Monday the tight timetable would mean the UK and EU might find themselves in a \"no deal\" situation for a brief period in the new year. \"I think the answer to that question is unambiguously 'no'.

But he has faced questions about why the Pentagon is imposing a 21-day isolation on returning military personnel, despite them not coming into contact with Ebola patients while working to build clinics in West Africa. Maine's governor is pursuing legal action to enforce her compliance. More than 13,700 people have been infected in total, the vast majority in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. People are not infectious until they show symptoms, usually a fever. One of these workers, Dr Craig Spencer, travelled around New York City before he fell ill. He is currently in isolation in hospital. On Thursday morning, Ms Hickox left her home on a bicycle, followed by police officers who monitored her movements but who are unable to detain her until they have a court order. The group has said it may shorten some assignments to West Africa as a result of recent state restrictions. Maine's Governor Paul LePage claims the state trooper is there not to protect the community from Ms Hickox, but rather the other way round. So far Governor Paul LePage, who is up for re-election in a tight race, believes that public opinion is behind him imposing limits on the nurse's movements. A judge in the US has ruled in favour of a nurse fighting a state quarantine order since returning from treating Ebola patients in West Africa. \"The fact that gubernatorial races are turning out as well as the Senate is nice news - they didn't get to run against President Obama, and a lot of them had policies to defend personally,\" he writes.

To date, there are over 700 monuments to the Confederacy - most, but not all, located in the South. Racial minorities, especially black Americans, feel that their presence in public life is offensive.

Then there is Tendulkar's insipid record as a leader - he won 16% and lost 36% of the 25 Tests he captained with what was one of the strongest Indian sides. His record as a one-day captain (35% wins) is way below that of Saurav Ganguly (53% wins) and Mohammad Azharuddin (54% wins).

Singles were seldom missed, and chances to convert these into twos were taken with confidence. New heroes have emerged, new hopes have been given wing. Dhawan and Jadeja, both of the twirling moustache and abundant confidence, have emerged post-World Cup, and must now go into the next one as the potential stars.

The law has created a national outcry, with critics saying it could be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) protects businesses from state laws that \"substantially burden\" their religious beliefs. There have been calls to boycott the state, in response. Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed the legislation into law last week, but some of his fellow Republicans are already seeking to make amendments. Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate President Pro Tem David Long said that they will add additional language to the law to make it clear that it doesn't allow for discrimination against gays and lesbians. \"What we had hoped for with the bill was a message of inclusion, inclusion of all religious beliefs,\" Mr Bosma said. Mr Pence defended the law on television on Sunday but refused at least five times to say if it allows businesses to deny services to gays and lesbians. A chorus of criticism is growing, with the White House and companies such as Wal-Mart and Angie's List denouncing the law. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is openly gay, said his company was \"deeply disappointed in Indiana's new law\". Some companies have said that they are halting any expansion plans in the state. In a move directed at the Indiana law, Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy signed an executive order on Monday that bans state-funded travel to states that have laws similar to Indiana's controversial law, but that do not protect gays and lesbians from discrimination. \"When new laws turn back the clock on progress, we can't sit idly by. We are sending a message that discrimination won't be tolerated,\" Mr Malloy said on Twitter. The mayor of Indianapolis, which is about to host the final rounds of the nation's largest collegiate basketball tournament, has reaffirmed the city's protection of gays and lesbians. Mayor Greg Ballard, a Republican, issued an executive order affirming that any person or institution receiving public funds would have to abide by the city's human rights ordinance, which protects minority groups. Republican Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a revised version of his religious objections bill that he hopes addresses these concerns. The amendments mean his state's law more closely mirrors what Bill Clinton signed into federal law in 1993. Indiana also approved law changes which were signed off by its governor. The Indiana amendment prohibits businesses from using the law as a legal defence if they refuse to provide services to gays and lesbians, or other groups. The change does not apply to churches, religious schools, or non-profit religious organisations. It also prohibits discrimination based on race, colour, ancestry, religion, age, disability, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and military service. But opponents of the original laws said the language contained could offer a legal defence to businesses with religious objections to same-sex marriage - for example, caterers, florists or photographers that refused to offer services to same-sex couples. It does not allow businesses to use the law as a way to discriminate. \"This mirrors the federal law,\" Mr Hutchinson said at the signing ceremony, broadcast on cable television. The spotlight of criticism came to Indiana at an unwelcome time. The controversy has gripped the US political debate as the number of states that allow same-sex marriage has steadily increased. The US Supreme Court is expected to rule this summer in a case that could make gay marriage legal across the United States. Indiana lawmakers and business leaders, some of whom had originally spoken out against the law, stressed their state's history of hospitality and inclusiveness.

An established artist, her idea was simple but incredibly effective: selling T-shirts, handbags, posters and more with a unique slant on modern Cuban life. Many of the clothes and cushion covers carry their line's increasingly recognisable slogans: \"Actually I'm in Havana\" and \"99% diseno cubano\" (99% Cuban design). Clandestina may be a small shop but they have big dreams. Cuba is often considered to be a world apart, although it's rarely compared to being in outer space. I feel like I'm discovering a whole new world,\" she explains. Her idea was simple but incredibly effective: open Havana's first design store. She is already in talks with a business partner in New York about selling her products outside the island. Amid the new buzz around young Cuban private business owners, Idania and her partner have been feted by foreign investors, keen to hear how to launch a successful business in Cuba. \"Maybe this doesn't work out and maybe next year we are out of business. Education is one of the pillars of the Cuban Revolution. If there is not a good teacher, there is not a good doctor, a good architect, a good engineer, a good carpenter or a good fisherman.

It was a brave move. For X, if the recent changes on the island achieve anything, they should underline the similarities between Cubans and the rest of the world. \"Design is not unique in Cuba, but what is maybe unique to us is commercialising a space for Cuban designers,\" explains Leire Fernandez, co-founder of the brand. Clandestina, however, is unabashedly a shop. Business has been brisk, almost from day one. Their products have been selling fast and the small shop is often full of free-spending tourists. Cuba is changing, it's not a secret,\" acknowledges Idania. Clandestina is often held up as an example of a successful Cuban private business.

The inquest also heard from Dr Kate Clark, consultant in emergency medicine, who revealed coroners had issued a total of six \"regulation 28\" reports aimed at preventing future deaths involving ambulances having to queue outside hospitals in north Wales. Mr Robertson, the regional clinical lead for the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust, referred to guidance from the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee. \"The tragedy in this case is that Sam's condition was recognised and yet nothing was done, and that means there were failings within the system,\" Mr Jones said. Robert West, a professor in health psychology, and a government adviser, agrees. Regardless of what is happening to deaths, the issue that might force the government's hand is what is happening to the health service. Hospital leaders estimate the need for social distancing, segregation of Covid and non-Covid wards and the time needed for infection control means capacity is cut by 10-30%. That's not to say the health service cannot cope. The regional tier approach in England got off to a rocky start. It was widely interpreted as a rebuke of the plan, but those close to him say it was actually aimed as much at local leaders as it was ministers. It suggests the regional approach would be able to respond more quickly to rising rates than it perhaps has to date. \"We want to try everything before we think about a national lockdown,\" one government source said. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, along with asymptomatic cases, there could be more than 100,000 infectious people out there. The break for Easter will help slow the spread but that will only be temporary, she fears. What nobody can be sure of is just how quickly and by how much infection levels could rise in the coming months. Early evidence suggests the AstraZeneca jab could stop two-thirds of people who are vaccinated from passing it on. While some people have called for a \"Zero Covid\" approach, the government and its advisers are clear this cannot be achieved given the nature of the virus, which can spread without people being aware they are infected. And while it sounds high, it is worth noting that in a bad winter, 25,000 people can die from flu. There are, of course, as always caveats around these models. But they should act as a warning - while the UK may be in a strong position, nothing should be taken for granted with this virus.\n","Lengtg after cut: 816\n","\n","Ben Kingsley\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 639\n","is an English actor.\n","British actress Gemma Arterton has missed the Cannes premiere of her latest film, Tamara Drewe.

He returned in 2003 before leaving for good two years later, following a tabloid scandal. EastEnders executive consultant John Yorke told the BBC: \"Everyone at EastEnders is deeply saddened to hear that Leslie has passed away. \"We were both really lucky that we were cast opposite each other,\" she went on. Dobson said she had been intending to visit Grantham in hospital on Friday to say goodbye and tell him \"you made TV history\". In a statement, she added: \"I always enjoyed talking to him, he made me laugh and always had a twinkle in his eye when he said outrageous things. \"He was a wonderful and special actor, witty and very talented. Letitia Dean, who played Den's daughter Sharon, released a statement saying \"thank you for everything\" to Grantham. She said: \"I have very special memories of working with Leslie and will cherish them always. He and Anita looked after me in my early days and showed me the ropes, always with care and kindness. \"He never failed to make me laugh and I will remember him with love, affection and gratitude forever. Grantham rose to fame when he was cast as the landlord of the Queen Vic, the east London public house around which the action in EastEnders revolves. But Grantham's life was not without controversy. In 1966, he was convicted of murdering a German taxi driver while serving as a soldier. Shane Richie, who played Alfie Moon, said Grantham had \"had his demons\" but had nonetheless been \"a natural charmer\". \"There's no denying he was & will always be @bbceastenders greatest landlord,\" he wrote on Twitter. Dirty Den was an EastEnders stalwart from its first episode and stayed for four years, despite Grantham having only signed up for 10 episodes.

After returning to Albert Square 14 years later, Den was definitively killed off in 2005 and his body buried in the Queen Vic's cellar. He was reported to have been living in Bulgaria before his death, having gone there to appear in a TV series called The English Neighbour.

Ms Banda was sworn into office on Saturday following the death last week of President Bingu wa Mutharika. She had been vice-president since 2009, but had fallen out with Mr Mutharika and left his ruling party. No reason was given for Mr Mukhito's removal, but a BBC reporter says he had been accused of mishandling anti-government riots last year. Mr Mutharika, 78, went into cardiac arrest on Thursday, although his death was not confirmed until Saturday. He governed Malawi for eight years, but was recently accused of mismanaging the economy and becoming increasingly autocratic. Last year Mr Mutharika fell out with the UK, the former colonial power, which withdrew its direct aid, accusing the Malawian government of mishandling the economy and of failing to uphold human rights. The country has suffered shortages of fuel and foreign currency since the UK and other donors cancelled aid. Last July, at least 19 people were shot dead by police during anti-government protests over the worsening economy. Following the president's death, there was speculation that Mr Mutharika's inner circle was trying to circumvent Malawi's constitution to prevent Ms Banda from taking over and instead install his brother, Foreign Minister Peter Mutharika. Officials say preparations are being made to bring President Mutharika's body back from South Africa, where he was taken after his cardiac arrest. Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 75% of the population living on less than $1 (60p) a day. Equally surprising was her decision to publicly stand up to her boss - by refusing to endorse his plans for his brother, Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Mutharika, to succeed him as president in 2014 when he was due to retire. She was promptly thrown out of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party - and subjected to daily doses of derision at public rallies and on Malawi's state airwaves. Born in 1950 in the village of Malemia near the southern town of Zomba, Joyce Hilda Ntila was the eldest in a family of five children. Her father was the leader of Malawi's police brass band and her youngest sister, Anjimile, ran pop star Madonna's charity Raising Malawi until it closed in December. She left her first husband in 1981, taking her three children with her, because he was abusive. \"Most African women are taught to endure abusive marriages. They say endurance means a good wife but most women endure abusive relationship because they are not empowered economically, they depend on their husbands,\" she told the BBC about her decision. Eight years later, Mrs Banda founded the National Association of Business Women, a group that lends start-up cash to small-scale traders - making her popular among Malawi's many rural poor. She also set up the Joyce Banda Foundation, a charity that assists Malawian children and orphans through education - she has a degree in early childhood education. She held a number of cabinet positions under former President Bakili Muluzi and Mr Mutharika during his first term. She puts her achievements down to her happy marriage to retired Chief Justice Richard Banda with whom she has two children. \"My dear husband, Richard, has been the driving force behind my success and rise to whatever level I am now. My story and legacy is incomplete without his mention,\" she said. Mrs Banda's presidential challenges are huge: Aside from handling political divisions and possible opposition from Mr Mutharika's allies, she has to address Malawi's serious economic difficulties. And former President Mutharika fell out with most of Western donors - on which the country depends for financial support. The cutting off of direct aid resulted in the country's worst shortages of foreign currency, fuel and essential drugs. But she has immediately made her mark - sacking Malawi's police chief Peter Mukhito, accused of mishandling anti-government riots last year in which at least 19 people were shot dead, and Patricia Kaliati as information minister. The head of Malawi's state broadcaster has also been replaced.\n","Lengtg after cut: 877\n","\n","Warren G\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 935\n","is an American rapper and record producer who, aiding the G-funk sound, assisted West Coast rap's 1990s ascent.

In the mid-1970s, the band's allegiance to what they called \"robot pop\" set the sonic template for everything from hip-hop to dance music. \"They sound so detached,\" complained the NME. Gary Numan scored a number one hit in 1979 with the synth-heavy Are 'Friends' Electric, paving the way for bands like OMD, Depeche Mode and The Human League, who took Kraftwerk's sounds and transposed them to the industrial cities of England.

Set in South Africa, its two characters are former policeman Eugene de Kock, now serving a 212-year sentence for crimes committed in the apartheid era, and the black female psychologist who interviewed him in jail. Since the play premiered the two actors have had the extraordinary experience of meeting the real de Kock, regarded by many as a monster. Noma Dumezweni says it's always been clear London audiences are gripped by A Human Being Died That Night, the two-hander she's performing with Matthew Marsh at the Hampstead Theatre. But in London we worried at first that people would only vaguely remember the case. Matthew Marsh says there was a different anxiety earlier this year taking the play to Cape Town and Johannesburg. \"Possibly younger audience members didn't know much about de Kock but their parents did: there was a real frisson when they saw him on stage. It was a ruthless death squad doing a job de Kock thought justified to safeguard the white-dominated society he had grown up in. He has said he took no pleasure in arranging the bombings and kidnappings and acts of torture: he was acting on orders. As the play shows, he resents that he may spend the rest of his life in jail whereas politicians of the apartheid era and some senior officers escaped by saying the right things to South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Dumezweni and Marsh were able to meet de Kock when they performed the play in Johannesburg. \"He's no longer in high security and he's allowed two visitors a week. Then I was looking at him, searching for the man who did these terrible things. \"I was looking for any signals I should mistrust him or that he was manipulating us. Basically it's just two people in a room. Personally I think he's pretty genuine but he's a complex character. Pumla had nothing personally to forgive but many other people in South Africa suffered terribly at his hands. Nicholas Wright hopes people will see a relevance beyond the society the play is set in. Eugene Alexander de Kock, nicknamed \"Prime Evil\" by the media in South Africa, was part of the apartheid killing machine. Eugene de Kock at glance: Like many young Afrikaner males he first tried the army but he was disqualified because of a stutter. He became a policeman although his attempt to join the elite Special Task Force unit was turned down because of poor eyesight. In 1979 he found his feet when co-founded the notorious Koevoet unit. Swapo was fighting for the liberation of present day Namibia. He was arrested after South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994 when Nelson Mandela became president. He appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was set up by Mr Mandela and chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. At the TRC, De Kock confessed to crimes against humanity. He was granted amnesty for many of the crimes committed in defence of a racial segregation system. But he was sentenced to 212 years plus two life terms for the murders and crimes he committed which the commission felt went beyond the call of duty. Mr De Klerk, who shared the Noble Peace Prize with Mr Mandela for ending apartheid, denied the allegations. South African psychologist Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela interviewed De Kock many times while he was in jail. Whilst in jail, the former police colonel asked for forgiveness from some of his victims.\n","Lengtg after cut: 755\n","\n","Bronwyn Bishop\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 729\n","is an Australian former politician.\n","Australia's Prime Minister-elect Tony Abbott has unveiled his new cabinet, calling it a highly experienced line-up. The appointments broadly followed the line up while in opposition, but included a major promotion for finance. West Australian Senator Mathias Cormann was named finance minister over Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos, a move seen as a major endorsement from Mr Abbott. \"I think you can expect to see as time goes by more women in the cabinet and the ministry,\" he said. Several women also received appointments to junior ministries. Mr Abbott is expected to be formally sworn in on Wednesday. There are about half a million Muslims in Australia, making up just over 2% of the population. Three weeks ago amid a host of new legislation to tackle Islamic extremism, the Parliamentary Speaker Bronwyn Bishop announced new rules regarding \"facial coverings\". Instead they would be segregated and put in an \"enclosed area\". Many Muslims complained they were being persecuted and that the government was whipping up anti Islamic sentiment. The policy reversal apparently came after Prime Minister Tony Abbott suggested \"common sense should prevail\". Without doubt it has not been the Australian parliament's finest hour. She has also claimed expenses for travel to several weddings of her Liberal Party colleagues. Australia's rules about travel entitlements for politicians are hazy but Ms Bishop's spending set social media on fire and she soon became the speaker who sparked a thousand memes. She also claimed expenses for attending colleagues' weddings. Mr Abbott has himself had to pay back money spent on travel in the past. Ms Bishop has apologised and is paying back the helicopter costs but had, until Sunday, resisted calls to resign. Despite initially only receiving a slap on the wrist from the prime minister who put her on \"probation\", it became apparent over the weekend that Ms Bishop's refusal to resign from the Speaker's chair risked jeopardizing Mr Abbott's own political future. Mr Burke, Labor's chief Lower House strategist and an outspoken critic of Ms Bishop's use of travel entitlements, said in a statement on Wednesday that his claims were legitimate. Mr Slipper was attacked by the then conservative Opposition and viciously lampooned by the media. This week, as the dust settled over Ms Bishop's expenses, one of her chief accusers was hoist on his own petard. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who himself once repaid A$1000 he had claimed to attend a colleague's wedding, has committed to a \"root and branch\" review of entitlements. Mr Smith's election to the speaker's chair on Monday comes at the start of the latest session of parliament. She had ejected a record number of MPs in her relatively short time as Speaker. Mr Callaghan is one of many Australians who have taken to social media to mock MPs' travel expenses. Former lower house speaker Bronwyn Bishop last week resigned because of public anger about some of her expenses. The United Voice union said the low pay rates were particularly hard to take in light of revelations about MPs abusing taxpayer-funded expenses. \"Frankly, it's not a good look... Self-indulgence and waste of taxpayers' money could not be more stark,\" said Ms Ryan. Rumours that cabinet and backbench government MPs were once again worried about Tony Abbott's performance had been circulating since late last week. Many in the coalition have warned against removing Mr Abbott and repeating the disastrous leadership debacle of the previous Labor government. As Opposition leader he was best known for his outspoken ways, perhaps best exemplified five months after a 2010 trip to visit Australian troops in Afghanistan, where media recorded him discussing the death of an Australian corporal.\n","Lengtg after cut: 729\n","\n","Milton Jones\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 902\n","is an English comedian.\n","Keith Chegwin has come under fire for allegedly plagiarising other comedians' routines. Matthew Harris of intellectual property specialists Waterfront Solicitors say that, in theory, a joke can be copyrighted - but with shorter, snappier gags which rely on abstract ideas rather than specific plots, any infringement would be difficult to prove in an English court. \"The joke would have to be more than just a few words long,\" he says. In other words, he says, simply changing a long, detailed Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman joke to one with a Frenchman, a German and a Spaniard and an identical plot would not be enough to protect a plagiarist. But the more succinct a gag and the more generic the basis of the humour - politicians being crooks or Manchester being rainy, say - the less likely that a court would rule that anyone could not have come up with the quip independently. However, Mr Harris adds that were the joke sufficiently similar to the one allegedly being plagiarised, the burden of proof would fall on the defendant rather than the complainant to demonstrate that he or she came up with the idea alone. For his part, the comedian insists that he had come up with the jokes on his Twitter feed himself or \"remembered [them] from old\". However, fellow gagsmiths insisted that one example - \"My auntie Marge has been ill for so long we changed her name to 'I can't believe she's not better'\" - was the work of Mock the Week's Milton Jones. Other tweets were said to have been pilfered from Jimmy Carr and The Simpsons, according to Chegwin's accusers, comedians Simon Evans and Ed Byrne. Nor is the idea that the courts could get involved in such disputes entirely fanciful. In 2004 Jimmy Carr issued legal threats to fellow comic Jim Davidson for using a similar joke to one of his own. The comedian Dan Antopolski had to confront this dilemma after one of his one-liners won the best joke award at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. - was given the accolade, it went viral across the internet. His agents were also forced to issue a cease and desist order to a company which produced T-shirts reproducing the joke. Silliness may be what comedy is all about. But with the web making artists protect their intellectual property more fiercely than ever, such complaints are unlikely to be laughed out of court. BBC Wales presenter Jamie Owen has turned stand-up comedian to raise funds for Comic Relief. His act, one of many charity fundraisers planned for Red Nose Day, was broadcast live on the Radio Wales show he hosts with Louise Elliott.

Based in Brussels, the Commission is in charge of enforcing EU rules and the bloc's treaties. The government also published a 30-page document outlining its priorities for negotiations, The first meeting of the joint UK-EU committee, to discuss the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, is due to take place by video conference on Monday, with Mr Gove facing European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic. Mr Gove's letter comes amid growing signs of discord in the trade talks ahead of a key meeting next month. A recovery fund worth EUR750bn (PS670bn; $825bn) has been proposed by the EU's executive Commission to help the EU tackle an \"unprecedented crisis\". But Germany and France have backed plans for the money to be raised on the capital markets. On Thursday, the Brussels-based body called on UK to change the bill by the end of the month to \"re-establish\" trust in the negotiations. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement signed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in January, the UK must resolve differences over border arrangements with the EU through a special joint committee. Dread warnings about the car industry will prove to be overblown, currency movements (sterling depreciation) will help offset tariffs for exporters, and importers will source more ingredients and components from the UK. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has called for grace periods to be extended, to allow businesses more time to adapt to new Irish Sea border processes. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Mrs Foster said the \"disappointment\" for her was that the EU had not acknowledged the protocol was causing disruption to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Asked by Tory MP David Jones whether the \"bad blood\" between the two sides would cause long-term damage, Mr Gove said it would be \"better\" if the EU revoked the regulation in place allowing it to invoke Article 16 in future. Unionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union. Mr Coveney said Ireland was lobbying at the EU level to obtain easements on trade between GB and Northern Ireland. The UK government has been criticised for \"poking the EU in the eye\" over grace periods for Irish Sea border checks. Philip Rycroft, who led the Department for Exiting the EU between 2017 and 2019, told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour while there were issues around the protocol it was the \"least-worst option\" and had to be made to work. Earlier this month, the UK government changed how the protocol was being implemented without EU agreement. The minister said the Republic of Ireland had also suffered trade disruption as a result of Brexit. The UK continues to reject the idea of an agreement with the EU on plant and animal health measures (SPS) which would reduce the level of checks on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland because it would involve dynamic alignment with European rules in this area.\n","Lengtg after cut: 725\n","\n","Sally Edwards\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 513\n","is the CEO and Founder of Heart Zones, Inc She is a best-selling and prolific author, serial entrepreneur, professional triathlete, motivational speaker, innovative app developer and a living legend.\n","The owner of the caravan park where a landslip in October 2011 left 15 caravans teetering on the edge of a cliff says the coastline should be monitored more closely for erosion.

During the rain, some played a game called spot-the-England-fan as it was hard to find supporters of the home side in some of the stands. I mumbled to the England fan that not all Indian fans felt like that, and in fact the majority of us thought that he was a great role model and that we wanted to see more British Asians turning out for England. It reminded me of the anger I felt when Tebbit proposed his cricket test.

Another source of friction at the debate in Milwaukee was foreign policy. This was met with disdain by Mr Kasich, the governor of Ohio. Mr Bush, the former Florida governor, said it would tear families apart and played into the hands of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Other highlights: The debate, hosted by Fox Business, began by talking about raising the minimum wage, which several candidates opposed. Jeb Bush, who was more forceful than in previous debates, said that Hillary Clinton's campaign would be doing high-fives because Mr Trump's hardline stance on immigration threatened to alienate Latino voters, a fast-growing demographic. Florida Senator Marco Rubio said vocational education was instead a better way to unlock American potential. \"Welders make more money than philosophers.

It is considering a rival bill with fewer restrictions on how border agencies can spend the money. With the extra safeguards, it passed 230 to 195, roughly along party lines - with a few Democrats still refusing to back it. The White House said President Trump would be advised to veto the House bill if it landed on his desk \"in its current form\". Mr Trump's \"zero tolerance\" policy was announced in early 2018. By prosecuting adults who crossed the border illegally, it had the effect of separating children from their parents. They reported appalling conditions inside, in which children under 10 were caring for infants, and massive overcrowding. Traditionally large numbers of Mexican economic migrants have declined, replaced in part by a surge in families with children from Central American countries - particularly Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Many of these families are fleeing extreme poverty or the risk of gang violence. Border Patrol recorded 283 deaths in the 2018 fiscal year. Separately, a legal argument from the government that access to soap and a toothbrush were not necessarily \"required\" has drawn much criticism. But the public outcry was re-ignited on Tuesday following a report that many of the children had been returned to the Clint facility just days after being transferred out amid the public outcry. Several bodies, including those of babies and children, were discovered on the border in recent days, as some migrants opted to try and cross into the US illegally, avoiding the formal immigration system.

Six years ago in a Berkshire pub local resident Lanie Allen was discussing how expensive heating oil was for anyone buying just a few hundred litres.

Instead of tankers making individual trips to the village each time a customer orders fuel, suppliers can make all their deliveries in one day, saving time and diesel. Mrs Allen said: \"This is so unfair to the rural community. It said almost 30% of households without mains gas were living in fuel poverty.

Tilikum, the orca that killed a trainer at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010, has died, his owners have announced. He was estimated to be 36 years old and was born in waters off Iceland. Tilikum was featured in the documentary Blackfish, which criticised parks that keep killer whales in captivity. The investigation into her death ruled that Brancheau died from drowning and traumatic injuries. Tilikum had also been linked to two other deaths, which were detailed in the Blackfish documentary. Tilikum was then transferred to SeaWorld Orlando, where, in 1999, a man sneaked into the park at night and was found dead alongside the whale the next day. An inquest ruled that the 27-year-old had died of hypothermia, but officials also said it appeared Tilikum had bitten the man and torn off his trunks. Tilikum was SeaWorld's most prolific male orca, siring 14 calves while he was at SeaWorld Orlando - even though there were fears that aggressive traits could be hereditary. The company announced an end to its breeding programme in March 2016. It continued: \"Tilikum's life will always be inextricably connected with the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Dawn Brancheau.

Making sure certain rivers are fully stocked with prawns could prove to be an important contribution to fighting schistosomiasis. But it has been shown that prawns will avidly eat the water snails that host the parasite, breaking the cycle of infection that includes people. There, the Diama Dam was built close to the estuary in 1986, blocking the ability of prawns to migrate up and down the water course, decimating their presence. The inference being that the loss of the crustaceans was a major factor in the rise in infection. And her colleague, Prof Giulio De Leo, added: \"We ended up finding that something like 280 million to 350 million people live in areas that are endemic for schistosomiasis and could potentially benefit from this type of intervention (prawn re-introduction). The team is also examining the role other predators could play, such as catfish and ducks. Another idea is to tackle the problem at source - the dam. The capital investment required at existing dams could be very large, however.

Among other roles, he has served as Minister of Finance in Guatemala and as chairman of Oxfam International. From 2008 to 2010, Fuentes served as Minister of Finance in Guatemala. On 13 February 2018, Fuentes was detained, alongside all other members of President Alvaro Colom's Cabinet, as part of a corruption investigation dating back to his time in government. He resigned the same day as president of Oxfam International. Upon his resignation, Oxfam International's executive director, Winnie Byanyima, issued the following statement: \"Oxfam does not yet know the nature of formal charges, if any, against Dr. Fuentes Knight. However, he has been entirely open with his Oxfam board and executive that he has been among former officials being investigated as part of a budgetary transaction made by the Guatemalan government while he was finance minister.\n","The chairman of the charity Oxfam International, Juan Alberto Fuentes, has been arrested in Guatemala. He was detained as part of an investigation into a corruption scandal dating back to his time as Guatemala's finance minister. While his arrest is not related to his role at Oxfam, it will heap further pressure on the charity, which is still reeling from revelations that its staff hired prostitutes in Haiti. Some of the claims say the women may have been underage. The ex-officials are being investigated in connection with a public bus system, which was developed during Mr Colom's government between 2008 and 2012. The investigation is being led by the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). CICIG also said current President Jimmy Morales should be investigated because of alleged funding irregularities in his 2015 election campaign. Actress Minnie Driver has stood down from her role as a celebrity ambassador for Oxfam. This follows claims that staff for the charity in Haiti and other countries paid vulnerable people for sex. Oxfam said it was \"grateful\" for Ms Driver's commitment and that it was \"more committed now than ever to learn from our mistakes\". The British charity is accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011. Ms Driver, best known for the films Good Will Hunting, Grosse Point Blank and Hope Springs, said although she could not continue her 20 years of involvement with Oxfam, she would work against \"social and economic injustice\". The Charity Commission has launched a statutory inquiry into Oxfam - which denies a cover-up - but details of its scope have not yet been released. Oxfam officials are due to meet the Charity Commission on Wednesday. On average there are 600 cancellations per month. But Oxfam said there had been an increase in one-off donations on Tuesday. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said she would \"not hesitate\" to cut government funding to charities that failed to put robust safeguarding measures in place. \"It was not just the processes and procedures of that organisation that were lacking but moral leadership,\" she added. But some companies have spoken about their relationship with the charity. Since the allegations came to light, Oxfam's deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, has resigned over the charity's handling of the misconduct. In a separate blow for the charity, Oxfam's international chairman, Juan Alberto Fuentes, was arrested in Guatemala as part of a corruption investigation relating to his time as the country's finance minister. She said more effort should be made to alert the authorities and other potential employers about allegations. \"That's a practice that we need to start,\" Ms Mercado added. Her comments come after actress Minnie Driver stood down from her role as a celebrity ambassador for Oxfam. Ms Mordaunt, who is to speak to the National Crime Agency (NCA) about the issue, said Oxfam's failure to deal with the actions of some of its staff should be a \"wake-up call\" to the sector. The NCA said it had range of powers to investigate allegations abroad and would be considering how it can assist with \"international safeguarding considerations\". Prosecutors say the amount was inflated, with much of the funds being improperly spent. Mr Colom, who was in power between 2008 and 2012, denies any wrongdoing. The case comes during a difficult period for the charity, which has been embroiled in an escalating sexual abuse scandal. Morales's predecessor, former President Otto Perez, is currently behind bars, awaiting trial on graft charges uncovered by that same commission.

But critics say it is discriminatory towards Israel's Arab minority, which makes up a fifth of the population.

According to the Haaretz newspaper, only people with dual citizenship could be stripped of their Israeli citizenship. \"Members of Knesset who voted in support of the law have lost sight of a basic concept in democracy: That citizenship is neither a privilege nor a prize but rather a protected right,\" said Oded Feller, a lawyer for the group. On 20 September, Wadah Khanfar unexpectedly resigned as director general of the al-Jazeera satellite television channel after eight years in the post. Mr Khanfar's resignation announcement came as the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, left for the UN General Assembly session in New York, which some interpret as a sign to Washington that he has taken control of the network so he might calm down anti-US feeling in the wake of the imminent controversial vote on Palestine. What's clear is that the network's outlook often closely mirrors Qatar's own agenda, a country whose foreign policy can best be summed up as a delicate attempt to try and get along with everyone at the same time. From its inception, al-Jazeera has had a similar open door policy. Its motto is: \"The opinion and the opposing opinion\". Al Jazeera was the first Arab channel that allowed Israelis to speak uncensored. Al Jazeera focuses closely on these same troubled areas. Hugh Miles is a writer and journalist living in Cairo. Egypt, Saudi, UAE and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors from Doha last March, accusing Qatar of supporting MB efforts to topple their regimes. In a book he has written about Syrian conflict, Mr Bishara admitted that the Qatari government interfered in the editorial policy of Al-Jazeera. \"Up to this moment, there is no interference in the editorial policy from Qatar,\" he said. \"Our funding is from a Qatari-owned private holding company. We have no qualms about this nor have we ever denied it. Nor are we a political party or affiliated to any group of any kind,\" he said. Al-Araby TV is set to launch in London in January. The diversity of cultures and backgrounds of the new project's staff is obvious in the channel's newsroom.

Indulging such refined palates was not a matter of vanity for this modest Northumbrian engineer. Such a low-key commemoration reflects how mundane the tin can has become to us. In Paris, a financial incentive was offered. The miracle maker took the unexpected form of a confectioner from Massy, south of Paris. The French public and press were loud in their praises - \"Appert has found a way to fix the seasons\" said one paper. Within these pages, in a big red book entitled CB/3/6 in the society's library, it is revealed that Girard had been making regular visits to the Royal Society to test his canned foods on its members. Donkin, on the other hand, seemed to have a genuine interest in tin technology, and had already demonstrated a flair for making concepts work commercially. Within eight years, he had 18 so-called Fourdrinier machines in operation at mills around the country. In 1811, his papermaking machine business turned in a profit of PS2,212 much of which he invested in his new interest - canning. It was also near his home at the time, in Charlotte Place. The duke requested more cans to try out on his family and the following day, Donkin collected the glowing letter from the Counting House in Lombard Street. In Chile, there is a cove named Caleta Donkin, so called because the crew led by Capt Fitzroy were so delighted with their canned food. And each was numbered to help track its origins. But Donkin's company was making money - prices ranged from 8d/lb for carrots to 30d for roast beef. When Gamble exhibited an array of canned foods at the Great Exhibition in 1851, to widespread approval, it must have seemed like the tin can's switch from military necessity to household must-have was only a matter of time. In January 1852, a group of meat inspectors gathered at the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard in Portsmouth and proceeded to open 306 cans of meat destined for the Navy. They condemned 264 cans that day, throwing them into the sea. The remaining 42 cans were given to the poor. But the whole Goldner episode was a PR disaster for canned food, says author Sue Shephard. The slogan \"Empire Buying Begins At Home\" became the hallmark of cans under a new national mark scheme introduced in 1930, he notes. Canned food did help to maintain the empire, to an extent, says Philip Dodd of the National Army Museum, because it helped morale to have \"British\" food in the far-flung outposts. This boom among producers in the US and elsewhere meant that European households were experiencing some entirely new foods. \"So the miracle of the can continues, bringing to countless supporting industries added expansion and prosperity, to millions of people more jobs, better security and a better way of life,\" says the narrator. New kitchen appliances - refrigerators and freezers in the 1960s, microwaves in the 80s - widened food choice and led to a proliferation of foodstuffs on supermarket shelves.

The specifications for the ultrabook say it should be less than 21mm thick (and preferably much less), start up instantly, have a battery life of at least five hours and cost less than $1,000 (PS650). One way to aid that is by giving ultrabooks the ability to receive email, IMs and the like while dormant. That means, said Mr Rattner, those messages will be instantly available when the machine is powered up. There will be more waiting while it polls the server to see if anyone has been in touch. \"The PC has continuously demonstrated its ability to change with the times,\" said Mr Rattner. Such changes are going to be essential if the PC is to expand beyond its comfort zone of the back bedroom or on the lap of the couch surfer. It has to make these changes if it is to be useful when watching TV or driving a car at speed. \"It just has to be there,\" said Mr Rattner. Increasingly, he said, PCs will have to come to resemble those devices and jump to do our bidding when we are ready. \"The ultrabook is the first explicit evidence that the PC is not about to curl up and die,\" he said. Chip maker Intel has set up a laboratory in London to test the technologies that could power the cities of the future. The Collaborative Research Institute for Sustainable Connected Cities was unveiled at 10 Downing Street. Intel is partnering with Imperial College and University College London. The aim of the institute will be to find real-life applications for technology to enhance city life. Initially a dozen researchers will work at the institute. It will aim to solve problems related to the environment, as well as the social and economic issues faced by growing cities. \"In 2050, most of the nine billion people in the world will live in cities,\" said Intel's chief technology officer Justin Rattner. Anthropologists with work alongside computer scientists to make sure that the social needs of the population were taken into account, he said. Other projects will include a network of sensors to monitor air quality, traffic flow, water supply and other parameters. One of the most important tasks for the researchers will be extracting meaning from the huge amounts of data created by the project. The centre's first study will be the summer Olympics. \"Poring over the data from such an event to see what systems worked and which didn't - that is a great experiment in the the making,\" said Mr Rattner. Chancellor George Osborne welcomed the lab as another step towards making the UK the tech hub of Europe. It is encouraging to see major tech partners like Intel investing in this country,\" he said. The new institute will form part of Intel Labs. There are 40 such labs across Europe, all investigating different tech-related issues.\n","Lengtg after cut: 707\n","\n","Colin Farrell\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 756\n","is an Irish actor.

Theatre playwright McDonagh, who won an Oscar for his first short film Six Shooter and was nominated for the screenplay to his debut feature In Bruges, gives a rather prosaic explanation for his film's title. By taking aim at Hollywood conventions on sex and violence, McDonagh could be accused of biting the hand that feeds him. Saving Mr Banks, a film about the making of Mary Poppins, contains several scenes you might not expect to see in a Disney film. Disney had been after the rights to the book for 20 years and the film focuses on a trip Travers makes from London to Hollywood in 1961 to finally discuss the project with Disney face-to-face.

It also is only the latest example of Mr Trump flexing his presidential powers in a way that is markedly different from his predecessors - and could have serious implications for US politics. It was the Obama film, he claims, that led Manhattan-based US Attorney Preet Bharara to target him for prosecution in order to curry favour with the Obama administration.

Mr Trump reportedly said Ali, who died in 2016, was one of 3,000 people he was considering pardoning, saying many of these people \"have been treated unfairly\". Or, at the very least, he's enamoured by the spectacle and speculation that he's managed to create by publicly entertaining ways to use his broad pardon power. He's throwing names out and clearly enjoying the new game he's created. If nothing else, his presidency keeps everyone guessing as to what will happen next. He said fighting in a war he did not believe in would disgrace his religion, his people and himself. Ali famously declared he \"ain't got nothing against no Viet Cong\" after he was reclassified as eligible for service. He faces charges of tax fraud, money laundering, and illegal lobbying. US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said on Friday that Mr Manafort had \"abused the trust placed in you\" and treated the court proceedings as \"just another marketing exercise\". Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was even more direct, telling a New York newspaper that the Manafort situation could eventually get \"cleaned up\" by presidential pardons. Last week, Mr Manafort and his aide, Konstantin Kilimnik, were charged with witness tampering. President Donald Trump has pardoned two Oregon cattle ranchers whose sentence for arson led armed militiamen to seize control of a wildlife refuge in 2016.

Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has acknowledged wearing \"brown makeup\" to a party, days after the state governor admitting wearing blackface. Mr Herring had joined calls for Governor Ralph Northam to quit over a racist photo and blackface scandal. The lieutenant governor is meanwhile battling a sex assault claim. If they were to resign over these controversies, Virginia could be led by the Republican Speaker of the House of Delegates, Kirk Cox.

She says she was friends with Mr Fairfax while they studied at Duke University, but that they never had a romantic relationship. He demanded a full investigation to \"clear my good name\". There's no better person to do that than a doctor. Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax meanwhile has been denying claims of sexual assault and rape. Mr Fairfax said her statement had been \"painful\", but insisted he was innocent. Unlike indentured servants, who were typically released after paying off the debt of their voyage to America, black slaves were rarely freed. \"A historian advised me that the use of indentured was more historically accurate. \"With respect to the photograph on Governor Northam's personal page, we could not conclusively determine the identity of either individual depicted in the photograph,\" said the report.

The colour cyan - between green and blue - is a hidden factor in encouraging or preventing sleep, according to biologists. The impact was felt even if colour changes were not visible to the eye. The researchers want to produce devices for computer screens and phones that could increase or decrease cyan levels. There have been \"night mode\" settings for phones and laptops which have reduced blue light in an attempt to lessen the damage to sleep. He said this could also affect other colours which were made using cyan. For instance, there are shades of green that can include cyan - which also can be achieved using other colour combinations. The researchers suggest that versions of the colour using cyan could be used on computer screens if the aim was to keep people awake - such as people working and required to stay alert at night. Or there could be another version, the same colour but without cyan, which could be used if the aim was reduce disruption to sleep. The research team, headed by Prof Lucas and Dr Annette Allen, says there could be applications for this discovery on computer screens, televisions and smartphones. \"This outcome is exciting because it that tells us that regulating exposure to cyan light alone, without changing colour, can influence how sleepy we feel,\" said Prof Lucas.

Mark Turner, who operates Solway Tours, described the area as an \"incredible resource\". He said they took people from across the world to Galloway to show off its sites, enjoy its walking and cycling trails and tell them the story of Robert the Bruce. \"If the area was to gain national park status we can only see it as a huge positive,\" he said. However, Colin Ferguson, who chairs the National Farmers Union Scotland in Dumfries and Galloway, said he did not see the need for \"another layer of bureaucracy\". \"It is the biggest industry in the region and it provides a huge amount of employment - up to 12,000 people,\" he said.

During the trial he denied the charges, saying that \"a court of occupiers cannot be just\". Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014, triggering condemnation from many countries. Meanwhile, Russia's human rights ombudswoman was expected to travel to Ukraine to visit Kyrylo Vyshynsky, a Ukrainian-Russian journalist accused of treason.

Darren King, 31, of Suffolk, died after suffering a seizure in his bath in 2017. The General Medical Council (GMC) - the doctors' watchdog - has apologised for its \"inadequate\" checks in the 1990s. The BBC can now reveal how Alemi, who was assigned Mr King's case while working for the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT), had refused a family request to do a capacity assessment on the risks of him living independently. \"He needed an assessment around his understanding of his medication along with alcohol and the seizures which he didn't know he was having,\" said Mr King. \"We haven't got to worry about him, but someone shouldn't be allowed to turn up and say 'I am a doctor' and just carry on as if they are. After Alemi's departure from the trust, Mr King was not assigned to another psychiatrist. \"We need to reach out to them to provide them with the necessary support and assurances. But when she moved to the UK in 1995, the GMC did not have procedures in place to check on her record. It took a further four years before Alemi was stopped and suspended. Alemi is behind bars for changing the will of a patient and her medical qualification in New Zealand has been exposed as a fraud. The parents of one patient, Darren King from Lowestoft, said he could still be alive if the fake doctor had done her job properly. His family said Alemi refused to carry out their request for a capacity assessment, although they wanted the bath to be removed. It has since come to light from Alemi's disciplinary record that concerns were first raised about her conduct and practice by other medical staff in 2010. She was given two warnings, and conditions were imposed on her. These were later removed and it was not until more than seven years later that she was stopped from treating patients. On Wednesday, the trust was rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission for a third time. Zholia Alemi, jailed in 2018 for fraud, worked around the UK and for the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust (NSFT), despite being unqualified. Norfolk and Suffolk mental health campaigners said it was \"shocking\" and called for a full external audit. Mr King drowned in his bath after having a seizure in 2017. NSFT said: \"All the appropriate checks had been undertaken by the GMC. We checked that the GMC and the agency had run the necessary checks. Zholia Alemi, who practised for 22 years with no qualifications, saw Mr King twice between 2014 and 2015. A coroner ruled Mr King's death on 9 April 2017 was accidental but potentially preventable. Mr King's family had voiced concerns about Alemi after she refused to complete a safety assessment and believed she contributed to his death. Senior coroner for Suffolk, Nigel Parsley, said she was \"one of a number of psychiatrists\" who saw Mr King but expert reviews of Alemi's treatment \"could not identify an act or omission that led directly to Darren's death\". She was jailed for five years for fraud in 2018 after changing a patient's will to benefit herself. Mr Parsley said Mr King had an \"identified poor record for attending medical and social care meetings\" but that a worsening of this \"coincided with staff changes\". His last contact with his NSFT care co-ordinator was in June 2016, and he last saw his GP in September 2016. \"Had opportunities to provide adequate monitoring and treatment relating to Darren's epilepsy been taken, then his death may have been prevented,\" he said.

A conventional dry-cell battery uses two electrodes separated by an electrolyte. The difference in composition between the two liquid metals gives rise to a voltage. Grid storage could be to help make renewables such as wind, wave and solar power competitive with traditional energy sources. Wind speeds, and the amount of sunlight we receive, vary from day to day. Experts estimate that within three years, the ability to get electricity in Manhattan is going to be exceeded by demand from the island. \"There's no one-size-fits all solution to storage on the grid, it's going to require different solutions because the size of the storage and the timescales you need to store them over are so vast...

The income map reveals a clear regional divide in how wealthy Nigerians are, with the north being much poorer than the south of the country. One of the most prominent is that a double is standing in for President Buhari at public events, which he has repeatedly and firmly denied. In response, a government minister called the story \"absolute fake news\" and Mr Ogunlesi, from Mr Buhari's campaign, says the story was used to deliberately target the government. Nigeria's president and leading opposition candidate have appealed for calm after the shock move to delay elections for a week. The PDP, whose presidential contender is Atiku Abubakar, on the other hand said Inec had delayed the election to create \"the space to perfect their rigging plans\". She believes this year's delay could slightly benefit the APC as it would increase voter apathy in most areas except those with historically high turnouts - \"the north-west and the north-east... both strongholds of President Muhammadu Buhari\". The federal government has accused the PDP of trying to \"scuttle the polls\" and prompt a constitutional crisis. Mr Abubakar said there had been \"premeditated malpractices\" in many states and wondered how states \"ravaged\" by the Islamist insurgency - in Mr Buhari's strongholds in the north - generated higher voter turnouts than more peaceful states.

Edna Beck subjected her neighbours in Hove to \"intolerable\" behaviour, Brighton Magistrates' Court was told. She had been overheard shouting \"Sieg heil\", performed a Nazi salute at her neighbour and goose-stepped behind a visitor, prosecutors said. Local authority officials welcomed the interim Asbo granted to Beck. Mike Tyler, prosecuting for Brighton and Hove City Council, said young children had been left frightened after she called them \"Hitler's children\" as they played in the garden. He said: \"She has thrown items at a flat door and deliberately littered the communal hall. \"She has thrown items, including broken glass and empty alcohol bottles, out of her window into the area of the basement flat.

Scott Gray had made a cup of tea at home and left it on the side while playing with his sons, four-year-old Archie and two-year-old Freddie. Moments later, Archie had knocked the tea off the side and on to himself. Scott said: \"I pulled his trousers and his skin came off too. Each year hundreds of UK toddlers, like Archie, end up in hospital with severe but avoidable coffee and tea scalds. But thanks to Scott's quick thinking and action - plunging Archie's legs into cold running water in the bath and keeping him there while the ambulance arrived - Archie's thigh burns could be treated without a skin graft and he's been left with no scars, say surgeons. Almost half of child admissions to specialised burn NHS services in the past five years in England and Wales, some 17,052, involved children who had been scalded by hot food or liquid spillages. In 2018, there were 6,645 child admissions to designated specialised burn services in England and Wales. More than 3,100 of these burns to children involved spillages from hot food or drink, and more than half of these involved children aged two or younger. Plastic surgeons from the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the British Burn Association say the way a burn is treated in the first few seconds and minutes is crucial to a child's recovery. Scott acted immediately and removed Archie's clothing and put him under running cold water. Archie, who lives with his family in Berkshire, was treated at the specialist burns unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital. His doctor, Mike Tyler, whom Archie and his dad affectionately call Batman because he is their \"superhero\", said: \"This is exactly the type of injury where good first aid with cooling can make a real difference to the outcome. Archie had scalded 5% of his body surface area and typically children with this size of burn may well require a skin grafting operation to the worst-affected areas and some form of lifelong scarring is common. But Archie's legs healed well and he was discharged without any scars. \"I am convinced that Scott's actions saved Archie from either an operation or a prolonged period of dressings and prevented him from having scarred legs. We regularly see children with such injuries, yet many people don't understand the benefits of cooling the burn straightaway. I'm extremely keen to get the message out that placing the skin in cold water for 20 minutes can have a dramatic impact on the outcome of the injury,\" he said.

Mr Mueller and congressional investigators may be interested in learning what Agalarov said that convinced Mr Trump to move ahead with the plans for a face-to-face gathering. Mr Trump said he had not been aware of his son's meeting with Ms Veselnitskaya until a couple of days ago. The documents \"would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father\", according to the email sent to the president's son by British music promoter, Rob Goldstone. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue, in Washington, says the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election has raised important constitutional questions about the extent to which an incumbent president can be forced to co-operate. Lawmakers from both sides of the US political divide have called for a delay in the vote on the nominee for the powerful Supreme Court. Prof Ford, a psychology lecturer in California, has accused Judge Kavanaugh of drunkenly trying to remove her clothing in 1982 when they were both teenagers in a Washington DC suburb. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley later said that there was no reason to delay Prof Ford's testimony as the aim would be to establish \"her personal knowledge and memory of events\". Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said he supported the call for an FBI investigation prior to the hearing. If Mr Pence became incapacitated as well, under the Presidential Succession Act Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives - a Democrat - would be next in line, although constitutional experts say such a transfer of power would prompt legal battles. The president has previously stated that he wants the conservative Judge Barrett confirmed before 3 November, in case issues surrounding the election end up before the top US court. Reports suggest he has told friends he wants to start a digital media company to take on the conservative network Fox News, whose full support he now feels to be lacking.

Conservatives don't like her because of her personal jabs at their leaders.

Ever since the 1987 World Cup, India have consistently been one of the favourites to win the title; they made it in 2011. There are usually four teams equally capable of winning, and this year in England is no different. Besides the hosts, who are the bookmakers' and pundits' favourites, Australia and India should make the semi-finals. But then the same logic applies to the others too. Of the two sub-plots in the World Cup, one is the anomaly of South Africa consistently \"choking\"; the other is India's unbeaten record against Pakistan. The Kohlification of the Indian team has already been accomplished, with the captain forging a team that is aggressive, fit and focused on winning rather than looking pretty.

In one of the most surprising election results of 2010, Castle lost the Republican primary to Christine O'Donnell. He would have been heavily favored in the general election against Democrat Chris Coons, who defeated O'Donnell by 17 percentage points.\n","The conservative Tea Party movement has won several victories over mainstream US Republicans in primary contests before November's mid-term elections. Christine O'Donnell was publicly ridiculed and written off by the state's Republican leadership, but she survived to score a resounding victory over the establishment candidate, Congressman Mike Castle, our correspondent says. She told supporters at a victory rally that her cause was to \"restore America\". She will now compete in Delaware against Chris Coons, the Democratic candidate for a Senate seat formerly held by Vice-President Joe Biden. Before the result was known, Republican officials had warned that they would not fund Ms O'Donnell if she won the primary. \"We have to rise above this nastiness and unify for the greater good, because there's a lot of work to be done and there are a lot of people who want to get involved if the Republican Party would,\" she was quoted by the Associated Press as saying. \"Let there be no mistake: The National Republican Senatorial Committee - and I personally as the committee's chairman - strongly stand by all of our Republican nominees, including Christine O'Donnell in Delaware,\" Senator John Cornyn said, in a statement. It is a classic message-sending mid-term election campaign held amid widespread economic anxiety and pain. Whatever voters think of the Democrats' stimulus bill, healthcare reform and cap-and-trade effort, the main cause of the party's distress is not liberal legislation it promoted but simply that it is in charge when bad things are happening to the nation's economy. While this upset the party establishment, rank-and-file primary voters seemed content with the proposition. We are headed for a major pendulum swing. Since World War II, the president's party has lost an average of 24 House seats and three to four Senate seats in mid-term elections. Count on a doubling of those numbers in 2010. Every poll shows that Americans don't like or trust either party right now. Mr Obama can take some solace from his recent predecessors. \"I hung around people who were doing these things. I mean, there's little blood there and stuff like that,\" she said. After cancelling a couple of television appearances over the weekend, Ms O'Donnell tried to make light of the comments, asking reporters if they hadn't also spent time with what she called \"questionable folks in high school\". Mr Maher says he has more embarrassing clips and will continue to air them until the candidate appears on his show. Karl Rove, the man credited as the architect of George W Bush's presidential victories, accused Ms O'Donnell of saying \"nutty things\" and destroying Republican hopes for winning the Delaware Senate seat. She has said this was a mistake, and a computer error. Accusations that she inappropriately used campaign funds - to pay her rent, for example - have also surfaced. She is extremely guarded about her personal life. But it is the statements she made as a conservative activist which are generating the most controversy. \"It is not enough to be abstinent with other people, you also have to be be abstinent alone,\" she said. But the movement also cost the Republicans seats they had once viewed as safe. The veteran Democrat and Senate majority leader held off Tea Party favourite Sharron Angle in Nevada, giving his party something to cheer about. In his victory speech, the Senator said Nevada had chosen \"to move forward, not backwards\". In the end, she lost to Democrat Chris Coons by 17 percentage points.

William Knight, 51, John Wadsworth, 46, and Patrick Jarrett, 49, all deny conspiracy to defraud and possession of criminal property. Preston Crown Court heard they pocketed money from selling raffle tickets for the Wounded Warrior Project UK Ltd. The charges relate to sales between December 2009 and June 2010. Sellers in military-style clothing sold tickets for PS2.50 with the chance to win a prestige car or PS10,000 in cash at high streets, shopping centres and event venues across the UK, the court heard. Collections were also taken in buckets while tickets were sold from stalls. The court was told more than 133,000 tickets were sold out of more than 180,000 printed and they generated sales of PS332,707. Prosecutors for Blackpool Council's Trading Standards department told the court none of the proceeds went anywhere near an injured serviceman or woman. Ben Williams, prosecuting, said Mr Knight, of Midgeland Road; Mr Wadsworth, of Church Street and Mr Jarrett, of Teal Court, acted dishonestly to defraud the public. He said: \"The defendants agreed with one another to sell raffle tickets as a means of making money for themselves. \"None of the proceeds went anywhere near an injured serviceman or woman. \"All this was really done to make the purchaser believe that all or at least some of the PS2.50 they handed over was going to this worthwhile cause.

Help for Heroes had previously worked with Keystone Fundraising, the company which ran the competition for the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP), on a different competition draw but the charity later cuts its ties and said it did not want it collecting funds on its behalf, the jury was told.

According to Harsanyi, however, the urgency of the matter is in the eye of the beholder. \"Authoritarians, great and minor, always claim more powers to fix some unprecedented emergency,\" he writes. Creators Syndicate columnist Mona Charen says that Mr Obama, and his supporters, have been corrupted by power. \"This is not constitutional government,\" she writes. Some, like CNS News's Terry Jeffrey, argue that Congress should not allocate funds for the federal agency responsible for processing newly legal immigrants. Still others are urging a government shutdown or that Congress begin the process of removing Mr Obama from office and even jailing him. Then there's another strategy some conservatives are advancing. \"The American people want that kind of leadership. Republicans were labelled the \"party of no\" for much of Mr Obama's presidency, as they rallied to block the liberal initiatives while in the minority. They will soon control both chambers of Congress, however, and Mr Obama's move - overreach or not - puts the focus on how they will respond. It's been a week of split-screens in American politics. As the days tick down until the holidays, and a new year, and a new Congress and a new president, here are some of the key political stories from this week. Texas asked the court to allow the state legislatures - which all happen to be controlled by Republicans - to determine who should get their electoral college votes. Election law experts largely scoffed at the prospects for the suit - \"utter garbage,\" writes UC-Irvine Professor Rick Hasen - but 17 other states with Republican attorneys general, as well as Trump himself, joined the effort. The ruling was slightly longer than the one-sentence response in a Pennsylvania case. Two justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, wouldn't have dismissed the lawsuit outright. And while his supporters may try a last-ditch effort to block the Joe Biden's victory in Congress in January, those political manoeuvres are destined to fail. The implications of this challenge, however, are unlikely to quickly fade away. That will be something Democrats, and the history books, won't quickly forget. \"From the instant the coronavirus invaded our shores, we raced into action to develop a safe and effective vaccine at breakneck speed,\" the president said. That was the message Biden was delivering to the nation from his transition headquarters in Delaware at the same time as the White House event. \"A vaccine may soon be available, but we need to level with each other. It will take longer than we would like to distribute it to all corners of our country. We will need to persuade enough Americans to take it. The president-elect said once inaugurated on 20 January, he would mandate mask-usage in interstate commerce and on federal property, distribute 100 million doses of vaccine in his first 100 days and prioritise reopening schools. Members of the House and Senate have been engaged in good-faith negotiations and continue to make progress. Republicans want lawsuit protections for business that stay open. Amidst all the turmoil surrounding Trump's challenge of the election results and the coronavirus pandemic, Biden continues the slow process of unveiling his nominations for top administration jobs. It looks like it's going to be a losing one for him.

It's pureed, sauteed and garnished in meals, eaten raw as a salad, used as a dip, fried as fritters and crisps. A glut in supply can bring down prices, hitting tens of thousands of farmers. Conversely, a shortage can send prices spiralling and trigger angry protests and even bring down governments. In 2010, the Congress-led ruling government was forced to ban exports and start importing onions to prevent street protests against rising prices. During the weekend at the Lasalgaon auction, supply was good and Mr Jain was picking up the crop between 8 and 9.50 rupees (13-15 cents) a kilogram from farmers. When stocked in archaic storage in India's blisteringly hot summers, they lose weight fast. \"What you sell eventually is considerably less than what you buy from the farmer,\" says economist Mr Gulati. A recent report by the UK-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers said 40% of fruit and vegetables in India was lost every year between the farm and the consumer due to lack of adequate cold storage. Back at the auction, Manoj Kumar Jain, says he cannot understand India's onion \"mania\". Despite this aversion to consuming onions, two generations of his family have grown rich trading the vegetable and that isn't going to end soon. In western Maharashtra state, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived. But traders, Mr Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop. Unfortunately India hasn't been able to make that happen,\" Dr Gulati said. There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Currently, less than 5% of India's fruit and vegetables is processed. Punjab, India's \"granary\", is a perfect example. \"They [the policies] are distorting the choices that farmers make - those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing wheat we no longer need,\" says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy. The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same. Experts say it's partly due to policies that encourage farmers to grow more and not less. What complicates matters is that farmers are a crucial vote bank. It was touted as eco-friendly, fast and effective. Inderjit Singh, a wealthy farmer in Punjab, says he didn't burn any stubble this harvest because he got a Happy Seeder last year. But some farmers say they don't have so much time between crops. \"We aren't allowed to plant paddy in the summer since the crop requires a lot of water and the logic is to conserve water during the heat,\" says Mr Grewal. More than 50 years on, experts say such intensive farming has not only led to air pollution, but is likely to spark other devastating consequences. \"Water tables in these states are depleting rapidly - future generations are staring at a water crisis,\" Dr Gulati adds.\n","Lengtg after cut: 783\n","\n","Oliver Williams\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 751\n","is an English cricketer.\n","Times are hard in Ireland - but the country still has heart.

Playwright Damian Gorman recalls an early emotional engagement with Spotlight. In fact, in a tale that has now entered Spotlight lore, Cornwell met his wife while making a Spotlight. In an act of almost obscene optimism, tourism bosses invited a group of travel agents from America to war-torn Northern Ireland in 1978 in the hope that they would send thousands of American tourists to holiday there. That did not happen, but some good came out of it. Spotlight programmes can sometimes have unintended consequences, but surely this is one of the more extreme examples of the phenomenon.

Activists have encouraged a boycott of Indiana after the US state enacted a \"religious freedom\" law, which they say discriminates against gay people. Supporters say the law prevents the state from forcing people to provide services contrary to their religion. The National Collegiate Athletic Association said it was \" especially concerned \" about how the law would affect its employees and student athletes. On Friday, Arkansas moved closer to passing a similar \"religious freedom\" measure. Mr Pence, a Republican, said he would not have signed the law if he thought it was discriminatory. Sponsors of the bill say it is closely modelled on a federal religious freedom law passed in 1993 and that 19 other states already have similar laws. But Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a Republican, said the law sends a \"wrong signal\" to visitors and could make the state seem unwelcoming. \"Sad this new Indiana law can happen in America today,\" Hillary Clinton, a presumptive presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) protects businesses from state laws that \"substantially burden\" their religious beliefs. Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed the legislation into law last week, but some of his fellow Republicans are already seeking to make amendments. \"What we had hoped for with the bill was a message of inclusion, inclusion of all religious beliefs,\" Mr Bosma said. Mr Pence defended the law on television on Sunday but refused at least five times to say if it allows businesses to deny services to gays and lesbians. A chorus of criticism is growing, with the White House and companies such as Wal-Mart and Angie's List denouncing the law. Some companies have said that they are halting any expansion plans in the state. In a move directed at the Indiana law, Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy signed an executive order on Monday that bans state-funded travel to states that have laws similar to Indiana's controversial law, but that do not protect gays and lesbians from discrimination. The mayor of Indianapolis, which is about to host the final rounds of the nation's largest collegiate basketball tournament, has reaffirmed the city's protection of gays and lesbians.

A seven-time Tony Award nominee, O'Hara won the 2015 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance as Anna Leonowens in the Lincoln Center Theater revival of The King and I. She also received Tony nominations for her performances in The Light in the Piazza, The Pajama Game, South Pacific, Nice Work If You Can Get It, The Bridges of Madison County, and Kiss Me, Kate. O'Hara also received a 2019 Olivier Award nomination for her performance as Anna Leonowens in the West End revival of The King and I.\n","O'Hara made her debut at The Metropolitan Opera in a 2014 production of Franz Lehar's The Merry Widow.\n","A Broadway musical based on the best-selling novel The Bridges of Madison County is to close after just 137 performances. The show opened to mixed reviews in February. The musical won four Tony nominations earlier this week, but missed out on the coveted best musical nod. Both leading lady - Kelli O'Hara - and Jason Robert Brown's musical score were shortlisted for an award. But in the face of sluggish ticket sales, producers took the decision to call time on the show's Broadway run at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre. Dame Helen, who beat competition from fellow British actresses Carey Mulligan and Ruth Wilson, dedicated the award to her husband, director Taylor Hackford. Her co-star Richard McCabe, who plays prime minister Harold Wilson, also received the honour for best featured actor in a play. London-born Alex Sharp, who plays a gifted mathematician with Asperger's syndrome in The Curious Incident, beat Bradley Cooper and Bill Nighy for the best lead actor award. When she was nominated in April, Elliott had told the BBC: \"We had no idea when we first started how the hell this play was going to go down. We had no idea whether there'd be an audience for it. The illness has forced the 56-year-old Japanese actor to delay his return to the Broadway musical The King and I in order to have treatment. Watanabe made his US stage debut last year in the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic and was to return in March. \"I was really shocked, my wife and daughter pushed me to have a health check and the cancer was found. It was a very early stage and they operated immediately,\" he added. Watanabe hails from the Niigata region of north-west Japan. He went straight into acting after leaving school and became known in his home country for his samurai roles. The actor was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in 1989 but resumed acting while still undergoing chemotherapy. He became ill again in the early 1990s and, following further treatment, has been in remission since. Yet its portrait of a white woman being both fascinated and repelled by a society depicted as both backward and barbarous can't help but feel patronisingly out of step with modern sensibilities. Not according to director Bartlett Sher, who insists it remains \"resonant, powerful and extremely well-conceived\". For many, The King and I will always be associated with Yul Brynner, the Russian-born caucasian actor who played the King in the 1956 film version and thousands more times on stage. Watanabe - who listens to Beatles music in his dressing room to help him prepare - told the BBC the musical felt \"very contemporary\". \"Either Rodgers and Hammerstein were writing ahead of their time or we're not learning,\" agreed Kelli O'Hara, his Tony-winning co-star. \"We're still talking about understanding each other across certain lines, about gender equality and religious understanding. According to Sher, efforts have been made to avoid \"decorative Orientalism\" and to show the King of Siam being realistically \"besieged on all sides by colonial forces\". The real King Mongkut reigned from 1851 to 1868, embracing Western innovations and initiating Thailand's modernisation. \"This musical is from the golden age of Broadway but is also absolutely rooted in another time past: a colonial age when Britain ruled the waves,\" Treneman continues in her five-star review. All the critics, meanwhile, are unanimous in their praise of US actress O'Hara, who makes her West End debut - and sports a convincing English accent - as plucky governess Anna Leonowens. The King and I continues at the London Palladium until 29 September.

His vision for geographic expansion in Asia and growth of the company's product portfolio has had high impact and in 2016 Dyson recorded a turnover of PS2.51bn. Under Conze's leadership the company is investing 2.5 billion into future technologies. Dyson has 40 new products in development, is launching the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology - a new university based in Malmesbury and has an ambition for new battery technology.\n","The engineering firm Dyson says it has made PS1bn ($1.58bn, 1.19bn euros) turnover for the first time and will create 300 skilled jobs, around 8% of its workforce. Dyson designs its products in the UK but after initially making them in the UK, moved much of the manufacturing to Malaysia to cut costs. It did not reveal its profit figure for the year. In 2010, the business made a profit of PS210m on turnover of PS887m. In 2015, he lost a major legal battle in his bid to prove the tests gave misleading higher efficiency ratings to rivals' appliances. This successful appeal against that ruling will see the claim sent back to the original EU court for judgement. A spokesperson at Dyson said they were \"shocked and delighted\". Sir James, a high profile campaigner for Brexit, had previously argued that EU law discriminated in favour of his company's rivals, which include Germany's Bosch and Siemens. Since September 2014, all vacuum cleaners sold in the EU have been subject to energy labelling requirements. Buying a vacuum cleaner these days is a highly technical operation, possibly as complex as buying a car. While not many consumers may study the labels in detail, the manufacturers and the lawyers seem to be doing little else. Electrical firm Dyson is suing former chief executive Max Conze for allegedly leaking company secrets and using company resources for his own benefit. These include \"the disclosure of confidential information, and a breach of his fiduciary duties\". His period as chief executive coincided with a huge increase in sales of Dyson's products. The breaches are said to include: \"Disclosing confidential product information to third parties, breaching Dyson's confidentiality rules. \"Using Dyson resources and information to evaluate an investment opportunity for his own benefit and/or for the benefit of a venture capital firm, rather than for Dyson's benefit - breaching his fiduciary duties. The action will be lodged in the High Court on Wednesday. Dyson would not comment on whether the breaches were in connection with its project to build a new electric car, which had been long under wraps and only recently revealed. Max Conze stepped down in October and was thanked by the British firm's founder, Sir James Dyson. But the BBC has learned that, according to the company, Mr Conze was sacked for an alleged series of breaches. Mr Conze was appointed to the role in 2011 after a stint running Dyson's US business. Profits at the vacuum cleaner and air purifier maker rose 41% last year to PS631m. In response, Mr Conze said: \"I did nothing of the sort. \"This couldn't have happened without my total commitment to the business and its people,\" he said. I understand that Max Conze, sacked abruptly by Dyson in October for a series of alleged \"breaches\", received a multi-million-pound settlement. They included \"disclosing confidential product information to third parties\". Dyson is seeking an extra 300 engineers in a push to build its first electric car by 2020. The jobs news came as it revealed 2017 underlying earnings rose 27% to PS801m. The privately-owned firm is yet to decide where its electric cars - once they have been designed - will be manufactured. Sir James also said the firm had \"moved on\" from its dispute with former Dyson chief executive Max Conze over the alleged disclosure of confidential information. Mr Conze worked for the company for six years before being replaced in October by chief operating officer Jim Rowan.\n","Lengtg after cut: 820\n","\n","Peter McDowell\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 757\n","is an American politician who represented the 4th Barnstable District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1975 to 1979.\n","Concern over a \"temperamental\" bollard has lead to the cancellation of a pancake race in County Durham. Bishop Auckland was due to host the event on Fore Bondgate but it was called off on the advice of police, who raised safety concerns. It was feared that the rising bollard would fail, allowing traffic onto the street while the race was taking place. Organiser Durham County Council said it hoped to provide back-up measures in future so the event could take place. Lesley Zair, who runs a local cafe which would have provided the pancakes for free, described the decision as \"disappointing\". \"It is a free event for people in the town and has been well supported over the past couple of years,\" she said. Durham Police said in a statement: \"The last thing we want to do is prevent events of this nature taking place as they are good for the area, however, we have to be certain road safety is not compromised. Peter McDowell, business service manager at Durham County Council, said: \"The bollard can be temperamental and road safety advice from the police indicated concerns about its operation and the safety of pedestrians taking part in the race. An \"east-west divide\" has opened up in the number of start-ups created across the north of England, research reveals. Data suggests a larger number of start-up firms are thriving on the west side of the Pennines, with significantly fewer to the east. This runs contrary to the government's Northern Powerhouse ambition to \"level up\" the North, the study said. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it remains \"committed to the Northern Powerhouse\". The Enterprise Research Centre (ERC) said its findings strengthened the case for better east-west rail links, and challenged the government to do more to help foster \"best practice\" for businesses. The study analysed the latest available data for start-up rates, from 2018. It found Greater Manchester's rate was among the highest in the UK, with 58 per 10,000 population. But while neighbouring regions including Merseyside and Cheshire also showed healthy rates, many eastern areas \"lagged far behind\", with the north-east having the lowest rate of just 19 per 10,000. Peter McDowell, of Business Durham, which supports economic growth in the region, said there was a \"natural cultural tendency\" for many people in the north-east to join large employers, with the region traditionally regarded as a manufacturing and an \"export economy\" rather than a haven for start-ups. He said the region also struggles to retain university graduates, with many choosing to return to regions with larger urban economies. The north-east has lagged behind many other parts of the country. It would be the same if you compared it with North Wales, or the south. Greater Manchester also had the highest proportion of start-ups that manage to reach the PS1m turnover milestone within three years (2.2%). East of the Pennines, start-up growth was generally slower, with the exception of the Sheffield City Region (2.1%). The ERC has presented its findings in a meeting involving local authorities across the Northern Powerhouse area. The government defined the Northern Powerhouse as stretching northwards from a line running between the Mersey estuary in the west, to the Humber estuary in the east. The ERC's deputy director Mark Hart said: \"While the current political rhetoric talks of 'levelling up', what we're seeing in business dynamism terms is a clear 'east-west divide' emerging.\n","Lengtg after cut: 757\n","\n","Mary Kennedy\n","creating new bio\n","Length before cut: 684\n","is an Irish television personality and former newscaster, and writer.\n","Robert F Kennedy Jr's estranged wife has been found dead at her home in New York state.

But they were looking for something,\" Mrs Connolly said. There have been allegations that the rubber bullet had been doctored to add a battery to the cartridge. The court had previously examined what a soldier would have been able to see from inside an armoured vehicle. A barrister for the Ministry of Defence later pointed out that Mrs Connolly had given a rather different statement to HET officers in July 2010. Mrs Connolly told the court she did not lie in 2010, but now does not know what the soldiers picked up. The women - shown in photographs taken in 1929 - had been assumed to be tourists or visitors.

Since then, Bebo has struggled to compete effectively against social networking rivals such as Facebook. Criterion Capital's plans for Bebo are unclear, and the company was not immediately available to give further details. The San Francisco-based investor is now the proud owner of social networking site Bebo after buying it from internet giant AOL last month. \"We got a fair deal - we're very happy with the company we've bought,\" said Levin, adding that he was \"really excited\" about the future prospects for the company. Bebo's strategy, Levin said, will not be to take on bigger rivals. \"Facebook have won the social networking battle - it's over,\" said Dan Wagner, a British internet entrepreneur who is launching his own social network aimed at fashion followers. Simply being smaller, though, is not enough. \"No one wants to sit in an empty bar,\" Mr Wagner pointed out. Dan Wagner agrees: \"The internet is a community of individuals and always has been. Compared with the ridiculous sum that AOL paid, a few million dollars for Bebo sounds like the deal of the century. But whether Adam Levin will see that money again remains to be seen. Its fading fortunes led AOL to dump Bebo for a reported $10m earlier in 2010. Over the last couple of years Bebo has struggled to remain a force as Facebook has grown to become the world's biggest social network. \"Things have moved on since the sale and I have a lot of thoughts and ideas about how to make Bebo relevant again,\" Mr Birch told BBC News. \"Michael was a pioneer in this space and his vision and understanding of the environment and landscape is crucial,\" said Mr Levin. Reversing fortunes Bebo was founded by Mr Birch and his wife and business partner Xochi from their home in San Francisco in 2005. It was seen as a significant player in the field, third behind Facebook and MySpace at the time. Mr Birch said he believed Bebo had something very different to offer. \"Facebook doesn't own the social networking space,\" he said. \"We are trying to fulfil a different set of needs.

Mr Cherry and TV network ABC have denied any wrongdoing and said they will present evidence that the decision to kill off Britt was made months before his argument with Sheridan.
