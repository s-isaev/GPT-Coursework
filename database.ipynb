      " is an American former businesswoman who was the founder and CEO of Theranos, a now-defunct health technology company. Theranos soared in valuation after the company claimed to have revolutionized blood testing by developing testing methods that could use surprisingly small volumes of blood, such as from a fingerprick. By 2015, Forbes had named Holmes the youngest and wealthiest self-made female billionaire in America, on the basis of a $9-billion valuation of her company. The next year, following revelations of potential fraud about Theranos' claims, Forbes had revised its published estimate of Holmes's net worth to zero, and Fortune had named her one of the \"World's Most Disappointing Leaders\". The decline of Theranos began in 2015, when a series of journalism and regulatory investigations revealed doubts about the company's technology claims and whether Holmes had misled investors and the government. In 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Theranos and Holmes with deceiving investors by \"massive fraud\" through false or exaggerated claims about the accuracy of the company's blood-testing technology; Holmes settled the charges by paying a $500,000 fine, returning 18.9 million shares to the company, relinquishing her voting control of Theranos, and being barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years. In June 2018, a federal grand jury indicted Holmes and former Theranos chief operating officer Ramesh Balwani on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for distributing blood tests with falsified results to consumers. A trial is set to begin on August 31, 2021, after being rescheduled four times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and her pregnancy due in July. The credibility of Theranos was attributed in part to Holmes's personal connections and ability to recruit the support of influential people including Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Mattis, and Betsy DeVos. Holmes was in a clandestine romantic relationship with her chief operating officer, Ramesh Balwani. After the demise of Theranos, she married hotel heir Billy Evans.\n",
      "Holmes's career, the rise and dissolution of her company, and the subsequent fallout are the subject of a book, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup, by the Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, and an HBO documentary feature film, The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley.\n",

      "Ocasio-Cortez drew national recognition when she won the Democratic Party's primary election for New York's 14th congressional district on June 26, 2018. She defeated Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent, in what was widely seen as the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterm election primaries. She defeated Republican opponent Anthony Pappas in the November 2018 general election. She was reelected in the 2020 election, defeating John Cummings.\n",
      "Taking office at age 29, Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress. She was also the youngest member of the 116th Congress. She has been noted for her substantial social media presence relative to her fellow members of Congress. Ocasio-Cortez attended Boston University, where she double-majored in international relations and economics, graduating cum laude. She was previously an activist and worked as a waitress and bartender before running for Congress in 2018.\n",
      "Along with Rashida Tlaib, Ocasio-Cortez is the first female member of the Democratic Socialists of America elected to serve in Congress. She advocates a progressive platform that includes Medicare for All, tuition-free public college, a federal jobs guarantee, a Green New Deal, and abolishing the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n",

      "d editors into the full glare of the public spotlight. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters and Harry filed proceedings at the High Court against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking. As such a dramatic year came to a close, the royal couple took an extended break from royal duties over Christmas, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped their bombshell announcement. Neither Harry's father, Prince Charles, nor his older brother, Prince William, with whom Harry has said he has \"good days\" and \"bad days\", were consulted. Harry and Meghan were, they told their Instagram followers, planning to leave their royal duties - and the royal purse - behind. They hope their next chapter, spent in North America as well as the UK, will see the two of them, together with baby Archie, make their own path to the future.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's decision to \"step back\" as senior members of the Royal Family has generated interest across the world. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are said to have \"blindsided\" Buckingham Palace with the announcement, which the couple said came after \"many months of reflection\". They said they intended to become financially independent while continuing to support  the Queen. But what does it mean for their future? Will the duke still be in the line of succession? And what if the couple split up? BBC royal correspondent Sarah Campbell answers readers' questions. Succession to the throne in the UK is not only due to birth, but also legislation. It would take an Act of Parliament to remove a person from the line of succession. Downing Street has so far said that questions on the duke and duchess's announcement are \"for the royal household\". It is worth noting that, as the Cambridge family expands, Prince Harry will keep moving down the line of succession. Archie has no title - that was his parents' decision when he was born. He is simply Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. There is no suggestion the duke and duchess wish to renounce their titles. He remains a member of the Royal Family - stepping back from duties does not change that. Moreover, what the couple plan to do has not been tried before, so there is no precedent to guide us. This rule applies to some applicants for British citizenship. We were told that Meghan was not going to be fast-tracked to get citizenship and it will take the same length of time for her as for anyone else. We are not aware she is a dual citizen as yet (as in, that she has a British passport). Buckingham Palace did not respond when asked whether the duchess's citizenship application would be affected by the announcement. Meghan has talked about the fact that, even though she was already in the public eye, she was not prepared for the huge press interest  which came with marrying into the Royal Family. We simply do not know how much support the duke and duchess have been given, so it is difficult to say whether they should have been given more. The next Invictus Games is to be held this year in The Hague. The Invictus Games Foundation - with Prince Harry as patron - was established to preside over the games and, as it is a separate entity, it will continue regardless of what happens with Prince Harry's status within the Royal Family. It will remain one of his key commitments. Prince Edward and his wife the Countess of Wessex are now both working members of the Royal Family with a busy schedule of engagements. But they both experienced difficulties when pursuing careers in the private sector: Sophie worked for a PR firm that was caught in a sting by a national newspaper and she was recorded making comments about members of the Royal Family; Edward had little success as a television producer. They both gave up their careers and are now full-time \"working royals\" paid for using income from the Duchy of Lancaster, the Queen's private income. Wallis Simpson was an American divorcee like Meghan Markle. In 1936, it was considered the public would never accept a divorcee as Queen. Edward VIII - the Queen's uncle - had to choose between the throne and Wallis Simpson. He chose her, thereby relieving himself of his position and all royal duties. Prince Harry and Meghan have said they wish to \"step back\" as senior royals suggesting they do intend to carry out some duties on behalf of the Queen. This is their choice as opposed to a course of action they have no option but to follow. But - it is early days and it is really not clear yet how their part-royal, part-private roles will pan out. On their website, the couple say they will continue to use Frogmore Cottage - their home on the Windsor estate - with the permission of its owner, the Queen. They say the cottage will be their \"official residence as they continue to support the monarchy, and so that their family will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom\". They add that the refurbishment of the cottage was planned well before they decided to move in and their decision to live there saved money when compared with the refurbishment of another property at Kensington Palace. On their website, Harry and Meghan say they will no longer receive funding through the Sovereign Grant, \"thereby making them members of the Royal Family with financial independence\". However, the couple say the grant only provides 5% of their income and it is unclear whether they will give up their other sources of funding. The couple will continue to be given a security detail paid for by the taxpayer-funded Metropolitan Police, which does not disclose the costs involved. The couple's intention to travel back and forth from North America would likely add to this cost, but it is possible they will pay towards this - although it will be a large bill. This comes after Harry and Meghan claimed on their new website  that 95% of funding for their office comes through income from Prince Charles' estate - the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy estate belongs to all heirs to the throne and has existed since Edward III created it for his son and heir, Prince Edward (famously known as the Black Prince), in 1337. According to a charter, the Prince of Wales, as the Duke of Cornwall, receives income each year generated from assets on the estate - which includes large parts of Cornwall, Dorset and Herefordshire - but he does not benefit from the proceeds or profit on the sale of any assets, according to the Duchy's website. This means that the territory - and income - of the Duchy will pass to Prince William, as heir, and on to his son Prince George when he becomes the heir. Therefore the estate itself is not owned by any one member of the Royal Family, nor is it owned by the government. Harry and Meghan's wedding in May 2018 attracted some 100,000 well-wishers to Windsor as well as a global TV audience of hundreds of millions. At the time, the Berkshire police commissioner Anthony Stansfeld suggested the cost  of securing the duke and duchess' wedding was \"between £2m and £4m\". Another recent comparison would be the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which cost the Metropolitan Police £6.35m - though it took place in London and was a larger event. The Metropolitan Police - which is responsible for securing the Royal Family - does not reveal the cost of day-to-day security or policing, so these costs are not known. Reports of previous estimates have suggested the cost of securing all senior royals costs the Met Police around £50m a year.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have marked their son's first birthday by releasing a video of Meghan reading to a beaming Archie. The clip, filmed by Prince Harry, shows the duchess reading Duck! Rabbit! - one of Archie's favourite books. It was posted on Instagram as part of a Save the Children fundraising campaign for children and families struggling due to coronavirus. Archie, sitting on his mother's lap, smiles and grips the book throughout. The couple are believed to have filmed the clip in the US, where they are living. Archie can be seen grabbing at the pages and at one point appears on the verge of tears before breaking into a smile. Prince Harry can be heard laughing in the background at various moments throughout the clip. In the video, Archie - who Meghan calls \"Arch\" - is seen wriggling around and reaching for another book midway through the story. He later drops the second book on the floor. When the duchess tucks it down the side of the chair out of sight, he reaches for it once more and again drops it on the floor - prompting a laugh from Prince Harry. At the end of the story, the duchess cuddles her son and says \"good job\", while Prince Harry cheers \"bravo\". Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was born on 6 May 2019, weighing 7lb 3oz. His parents introduced Archie to cameras at Windsor Castle a few days after his birth. On Wednesday, he received birthday wishes from the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on social media. Duck! Rabbit!, written by Amy Krouse Rosenthal and illustrated by Tom Lichtenheld, asks children to work out whether pictures on the pages are of ducks or rabbits. A caption for the video, shared on Save the Children's UK account, reads: \"'Duck! Rabbit!' with Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex (and Harry, the Duke of Sussex behind the camera)... Happy Birthday, Archie!\" It added: \"Thank you Duchess Meghan for helping us to raise urgent funds for our coronavirus appeal.\" The video is part of the charity's Save with Stories campaign to support children who have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Funds raised in the UK will go towards Save the Children UK's emergency grants programme to help vulnerable families purchase basic items and food, according to the charity.\nThe Queen, at the age of 94, is a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother.

He went on to study at St Andrews University, where he met his future wife, Kate Middleton. The couple were married in 2011. On his 21st birthday he was appointed a Counsellor of State - standing in for the Queen on official occasions. He and his wife had their first child, George, in July 2013, their second, Charlotte, in 2015 and third, Louis, in 2018.  The prince trained with the Army, Royal Navy and RAF before spending three years as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot with RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales. He also worked part-time for two years as a co-pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance alongside his royal duties. He left the role in July 2017 to take on more royal duties on behalf of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh. Born: 2013 Prince George of Cambridge was born on 22 July 2013 at St Mary's Hospital in London. Prince William was present for the birth of his son, who weighed 8lb 6oz (3.8kg). He started primary school in September 2017. Prince George is third in line to the throne , after his father and grandfather.

During his 10 years in the Armed Forces, Capt Wales, as he became known, saw active service in Afghanistan twice, in 2012 to 2013 as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and gunner. He left the Army in 2015 and now focuses on charitable work, including conservation in Africa and organising the Invictus Games for injured members of the armed forces. He has been a Counsellor of State since his 21st birthday and stood in for the Queen on official duties. He married US actress Meghan Markle on 19 May, 2018, at Windsor Castle. In January 2020, the royal couple said they would step back as \"senior\" royals and divide their time between the UK and North America. They said they intended to \"work to become financially independent\". Just over a year later, Buckingham Palace confirmed the couple would not be returning to royal duties, and would give up their honorary military appointments and royal patronages. Born 2019 The Sussexes' first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on 6 May 2019, weighing 7lbs 3oz, with the duke present for his birth. By naming him as they did, the couple chose not to use a title for their first born. When the name was announced, BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the decision was a strong indication the couple did not want to bring him up as a formal royal. Born: 1960 Prince Andrew, eighth in line to the throne,  was the third child of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh - but the first to be born to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They had two daughters - Beatrice, in 1988, and Eugenie, in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. In addition to royal engagements, he served as a special trade representative for the government until 2011. Prince Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after an interview with the BBC about his relationship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. The duke was heavily criticised for his friendship with Epstein, but he said he did not witness any suspicious behaviour during visits to the US financier's home. In a statement, announcing he was stepping back from public duties for the foreseeable future, the duke said he unequivocally regretted his \"ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein\". Born: 1988 Princess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York. She has no official surname, but uses the name York. She married property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi  at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020. The couple had been due to marry in May, but coronavirus delayed the plans. Born: 1990 Princess Eugenie is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie of York and she is 10th in line to the throne . Like her sister Princess Beatrice, she has no official surname, but uses \"York\". She married her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on 12 October 2018. Born: 2021 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's son, August, born on 9 February 2021, is the Queen's ninth great-grandchild. Born: 1964 Prince Edward was given the title Earl of Wessex and Viscount Severn on his marriage to Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999. The couple have two children, Lady Louise, born in 2003 and James, Viscount Severn, born in 2007. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company. He now supports the Queen in her official duties and carries out public engagements for charities. The birth of Princess Eugenie's son August in February saw him move down one place to become 12th in line to the throne . Born: 2007 Viscount Severn is the younger child of the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The couple decided to give their children \"courtesy\" titles as sons or daughters of an Earl, rather than the style prince or princess. It is thought this decision was made to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Born: 1950 Anne, Princess Royal is the Queen's second child and only daughter. When she was born she was third in line to the throne, but is now 15th . She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987. Princess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second is Vice-Admiral Timothy Laurence. The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. Born: 1977 Peter Phillips is the eldest of the Queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles. Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Born: 2010 Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips and the Queen's first great-grandchild . Born: 2012 Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips. Born: 1981 Zara Tindall followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple had their first child, Mia Grace, in 2014. The children of the Princess Royal do not hold a royal title, as they are descended from the female line, but she remains 19th in line to the throne.  Their father, Mark Phillips, turned down an earldom when he married Princess Anne, so they do not have courtesy titles. Born: 2014 The Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall gave birth to her first child, Mia Grace, in January 2014. Born: 2018 The couple's second child - the Queen's seventh great-grandchild - was born on 18 June 2018 at Stroud Maternity Unit, Gloucestershire, weighing 9lb 3oz. Lena Elizabeth was named in honour of her great-grandmother. Like her sister, Lena Elizabeth does not have a royal title and so will also be known as Miss Tindall.\n\n"
