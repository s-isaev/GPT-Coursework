Jeanne Seaver, a Republican delegate from Savannah, Georgia tells the BBC Mrs Trump \"spoke not only from her heart, but from her soul\" and that it did not matter that she may have lifted passages from Mrs Obama's 2008 remarks. Mrs Trump has adopted her husband's line that the media are conspiring to block his path to the White House. US First Lady Melania Trump has visited a hospital in New York to read stories to sick children as part of World Book Day.\n","Melania Trump has called on the spouses of world leaders to protect children in their countries. On Tuesday, the first lady's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, told Politico: \"Sadly, we deal with conspiracy theories all the time, so this is nothing new, just more silly nonsense. Wild theories have circulated online, including that Mrs Trump had moved back to New York with their son, Barron, or that she was co-operating with special counsel Robert Mueller. Since then, other people have had their own idea about some alternatives... Jill Vedder, wife of Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder, was one of them wearing her \"Yes we all care, y don't u\" jacket to the band's show in Milan.\n","The US President and first lady Melania Trump travelled to Windsor to meet the Queen, before they fly to Scotland to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. Earlier this week, James told CNN during an interview with Don Lemon that sport had offered him the opportunity to meet people of different backgrounds and race. Our reporters in Accra, Nairobi and Cairo have been gauging opinion on the streets: I can't work out how the State Department and the White House came to decide on the four countries chosen for Mrs Trump's trip. It said the article also wrongly claimed that Mrs Trump's mother, father and sister relocated to New York in 2005 to live in buildings owned by Donald Trump.\n","US First Lady Melania Trump received a poor reception when she appeared in Baltimore to speak about opioid addiction. He said he had hoped the statue would open a dialogue about the political situation in the US, including the fractious debate on immigration. In one episode, Mrs Winston Wolkoff describes how the future first lady reacted in 2016 after hearing of the Access Hollywood tape in which her husband crudely boasts of being able to \"grab\" women due to his fame. In much international media, however, the news was accompanied by criticism of what was said to be the US president's \"botched\" response to the coronavirus pandemic, and his \"open scepticism\" over the use of face masks and social distancing.\n","First Lady Melania Trump's office has announced the finalisation of the White House Tennis Pavilion, which has been in the works since October 2019. It was notable that Josh Hawley of Missouri, the first senator to announce he would object the results of the election in the Senate, did not step away from his challenge even after the Senate reconvened following the violence in the Capitol. Mr Trump's attendance at the G7 summit in Canada in June 2018 did not get off to a good start, when prior to the event, the president announced import tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, Mexico and Canada.

US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says he \"absolutely believes\" Mexico would work with him to build a wall along the countries' shared border. The president-elect, who is due to be inaugurated in less than two weeks, dismissed the actress as \"a Hillary lover\" in a telephone interview with the New York Times.\n","US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May held hands briefly as they walked down the colonnade of the White House. Many of the \"Tech Gods\" were dismayed when Donald Trump - who holds a very different worldview - won the American presidency.

Speaking at a rally in Florida ahead of next week's mid-term elections, US President Trump said a third of Americans believed that \"fake news\" media was \"the enemy of the people\".\n","The relationship between Donald Trump US president and North Korea's leader has been turbulent over the past few years.

Since January 2017, the US has added more than 480,000 manufacturing jobs, though analysts say growth in the sector is slowing down and Mr Trump's related policies - like tariffs - have not addressed the structural issues at play. UK politicians from different parties have all condemned Mr Trump's actions in encouraging the storming of the Capitol.\n","YouTube has become the latest social network to suspend President Trump. The Donald Trump baby blimp, which flew over Parliament Square during the US president's visit to the UK, has found a new home. At a Palm Beach council meeting on Tuesday, a lawyer for the former president explained that Mr Trump is a club employee, which means that he abides by a decades-long agreement stating that no-one could live at Mar-a-Lago unless they worked there. If the Democratic base decides, however, that the price of moving forward with Biden's political agenda was the failure to hold Trump fully accountable - for instance, by conducting a speedy trial without witnesses - he may pay a political price nevertheless.\n","Donald Trump has been ordered by the US Supreme Court to hand over his tax returns and other financial records to prosecutors in New York.

In the case of St Petersburg-based VKontakte, other factors may be at play. The social network has 40 million users in Russia compared with Facebook's 14 million, according to digital media analytics company Comscore.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has an interest in Navigator Holdings, which earns millions a year transporting gas for Russian energy firm Sibur. Two major Sibur shareholders are under some form of US sanctions. A commerce department spokesman did not dispute the revelations. The commerce department spokesman said Mr Ross had never met the three Russian shareholders. Others were imposed last year for alleged interference in the US presidential election. The revelations will again raise questions about the Russian connections of Donald Trump's team. His presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of the election. He has called the allegations \"fake news\". A special counsel is investigating the matter. Wilbur Ross and Donald Trump have known each other for more than a quarter of a century. WL Ross & Co, which was founded by Wilbur Ross, first invested in Navigator Holdings in 2011. Back in 1990, after a high-profile financial battle, Donald Trump opened his third casino in Atlantic City - the Taj Mahal, dubbed the \"eighth wonder of the world\". Mr Trump financed it with $675m raised through junk bonds at an interest rate of 14%. Trump biographer David Cay Johnston said: \"Wilbur Ross was a key negotiator in Donald Trump not having to go through bankruptcy and not being swept into the dustbin of history because he saw the value in the Trump name.\" Wilbur Ross became a board member of Navigator in 2012 but the commerce department said he was not on the board when Navigator signed its charter deal with Sibur that year. But Mr Ross was still a board member during the period from March to November 2014, when the US was sanctioning Russians over the annexation of Crimea, including Mr Timchenko and Mr Mikhelson's company, Novatek. During that period Navigator continued to increase its business with Sibur. The energy firm accounted for 9.1% of Navigator's total revenues in 2015, compared with 5.3% in 2014, Navigator's own filings show. Sibur has provided Navigator with $68m (PS49m) in revenue since 2014. There is no suggestion Mr Ross has violated any rules. \"I would advise any client who came to me to stay well away from Sibur or anybody else who has been sanctioned or has a relationship with sanctioned individuals... on the grounds, at least, of reputational risk.\" But Mr Ross appears to have maintained a close relationship with the shipping company. On the night that he was nominated as commerce secretary by President Trump, Mr Ross went to a restaurant in New York where he was congratulated on his promotion by the senior management of Navigator Holdings, Bloomberg reported. Mr Ross reportedly told the CEO of Navigator: \"Your interest is aligned to mine.

On Thursday, BP boss Tony Hayward was grilled by US congressmen who accused the company of \"astonishing complacency\" in ignoring dangers when drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. There has been a great deal of speculation about what assets it might sell. According to analysts at Moscow investment bank Troika Dialog, BP's stake in TNK-BP is worth about $16-$18bn.

BP made a profit last year of $14bn, down from $25bn a year earlier. Analysts say that the compensation fund and initial clean-up costs would, therefore, be easily affordable for BP. However, they also warn that the threat of legal action and significant fines means it needs to conserve cash. What they didn't catch was their negotiations with investors who want a piece of F1 in Russia. It is a surprising move as F1 tracks tend to be tough to sell. Their only take from a Grand Prix tends to be ticket sales. Revenue from television broadcasts of the race, trackside advertising and corporate hospitality there generally goes to the F1 Group which runs the sport. Ticket sales cover the running costs whilst governments foot the hosting fees as the races promote their countries to F1's 400 million TV viewers. The Russian Grand Prix is run by experienced promoter Sergey Vorobyev and although he hasn't released figures about the costs of the race, the hosting fee is estimated at PS33m ($47m). That remained roughly stable last year at 62,000 and figures have yet to be released for 2016. It is a far cry from the 120,000 attendance at the British Grand Prix but street races tend to attract lower crowds due to the difficulty of locating large grandstands in the middle of a city. \"Operating expenses are fully paid off by the ticket programme, it is cost effective.

The jeweller and entrepreneur Carl Faberge fashioned his eponymous eggs from gems and precious metals in his St Petersburg workshop a century or so ago. The first one was presented by Tsar Alexander III to his wife, the Empress Maria Fedorovna, at Easter in 1885, an annual tradition which his son Nicholas II also followed with eggs for his mother and wife each Easter Sunday. Of the approximately 50 eggs made for the imperial family between 1885 and 1916, 42 have survived.

They also sued BuzzFeed, which published the Steele dossier in January 2017. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed the Steele dossier on Twitter as \"fake\" and \"fraudulent\". The court motion also points out that Mr Fridman and Mr Aven lost a defamation case over an article that sought to link AlfaGroup to organised crime and drug-trafficking in the early 1990s. \"As our complaint alleges, Messrs Fridman, Aven and Khan brought this lawsuit because the allegations about them in the 'Trump Dossier' that Mr Steele peddled to the media are false. Christopher Steele was sued by three Russian oligarchs who claimed he defamed them by writing that they tried to influence the 2016 US election.

It is thought to be for his 22-year-old daughter, Ekaterina Rybolovleva. However, the apartment is not even thought to be the most expensive US property in Mr Rybolovlev's portfolio. But professional wealth watchers say it has bounced back with a vengeance and is now almost entirely detached from the ups and downs of the conventional housing market or, arguably, reality. \"Once you get to the ultra luxury end of real estate you are operating in a different market. Other properties which routinely get mentioned in lists of the most expensive properties are industrialist Ira Rennert's 63-acre waterfront estate, in the Hamptons, New York, which is thought to be worth $180m (PS114m), and Donald Trump's $125m (PS79m) Maison de l'Amitie, in Palm Beach, Florida.

In September 2010, brothers Nick and Christian Candy - the English property developers behind One Hyde Park - sold a penthouse apartment in Monaco to an unnamed Middle Eastern investor for $314m (PS198m). Billionaire Russian tycoon and Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, is also a fan of the Cote d'Azur, which like Switzerland has seen a boom in high-end property prices in the past few years. Villa La Leopolda, the 10-acre estate he is thought to have purchased from Microsoft mogul Bill Gates for $450m (PS284m) is often described in the media as the world's most expensive house. But the truth is we will never know for sure. However, the past couple of seasons have seen exciting developments with clubs Paris Saint-Germain and AS Monaco being bought by wealthy overseas owners. \"So the tax advantage that Monaco has is considered as unfair [by the clubs], especially in a period of economic difficulties for all clubs except Paris Saint-Germain,\" says Mr Haddouche. If not, they face possible suspension from the league. However, unsurprisingly, AS Monaco is not happy with this development, and has taken the matter to the French courts. A convention between France and the principality does mean that French players employed by the football club do have to pay their taxes in France. And Ms Moyersoen says that this fact might be one way around the tax issue, by looking at the number of French players employed by the club, with some sort of player quota requirement being a possible solution. The Geneva court's verdict means Dmitry Rybolovlev, the owner of French football team AS Monaco, will lose around half of his estimated fortune.

Advertisement It was published as a new report from Research Councils UK, the body that distributes civil science funding, warned that a reduction in its expenditure of PS1bn could result in a PS10bn fall in UK GDP as a result of lost synergies between the public and private sectors. The Scientists for Global Responsibility group campaigns for arms reduction. \"This year it received an additional PS1bn, to build new technical facilities when the question of whether the UK will build a new nuclear warhead design is up now in the air. The researchers also say that the successor to the Trident nuclear defence system should be scrapped. But according to Imran Khan, director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case), the scientists are wrong to think that cuts in military R&D will necessarily mean more money for civil research. The Duke of Edinburgh is retiring from royal duties this autumn, Buckingham Palace has announced. Prince Philip, who turns 96 in June, made the decision himself and the Queen supported him, a spokesman said. \"I'm sorry to hear you're standing down\", one man told him at a royal lunch on Thursday. The duke will attend already scheduled engagements between now and August but will not accept new invitations. By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent This is Prince Philip acting on his own advice, nearly six years later. Today's announcement is a significant moment in the recent history of the British Royal Family. A prince of Greece - with Danish, German and Russian blood - he has served the ancient institution, very publicly, for seven decades. As an outsider - who was viewed with suspicion by the aristocracy - he struggled at first. To his critics, he is a gaffe-prone prince. It's little wonder then that the Queen once called him her strength and stay. \"I think he is retiring now in order to have a few years of retirement and I think the timing is thought through,\" he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wished the duke \"all the best in his well-earned retirement\", saying: \"His Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme has inspired young people for more than 60 years in over 140 nations.\" Buckingham Palace publishes details of official engagements up to eight weeks in advance. The duke and the Queen celebrate their platinum wedding anniversary - their 70th - in November. They have called a halt to long-haul travel in recent years, with younger royals carrying out those duties. Royal commentator Dickie Arbiter said the duke is in \"robust health\", adding: \"He is not giving up on life, just stepping [down] from full-time public engagements\". But I don't think it's him disappearing, I think it's just him being very sensible, he's 95 years old. \"He's slowing down and I'm sure we will still hear and see of him from time to time.\" Sir Michael, who worked at Cambridge University before he retired, made outstanding contributions to geometry and topology. His brother Joe told BBC News he had been one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th Century. His research also involved deep insights relating to mathematical concepts known as \"vector bundles\". His work in these areas has helped theoretical physicists to advance their understanding of quantum field theory and general relativity. His passing is a terrible loss, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family. \"He will be greatly missed by friends and colleagues around the world Follow Pallab on Twitter\n","811\n","Nikol Pashinyan\n","creating new bio\n","[0, 5, 17, 19]\n","is an Armenian politician serving as Prime Minister of Armenia since 8 May 2018.

There have also been reports of a rift between Wagner and Gen Haftar over unpaid fees. All parties in the war have been reckless in their treatment of civilians, though Gen Haftar's side, she said, has committed more documented abuses that could potentially be crimes of war. By 2014 Gen Haftar had emerged as a power in the broken land, expelling radical Islamists from Benghazi, Libya's second city and the capital of Eastern Libya.

She thinks viewers, and the media, are enamoured with female figure skating in particular because our culture loves putting women on a pedestal and watching them \"torn apart\". \"Figure skaters are so mesmerizing to American audiences in part because they're consummate athletes whose sport also performs traditional femininity,\" she writes. \"A skater is everything a woman is taught to be, graceful and elegant, an ethereal figure reduced to the very fact of her body. She can seem more than human, almost angelic, until the moment she is brought down to earth.\" Advertisement In effect, it is the old Madonna/whore trope played out on ice: From \"Revenge\" to the \"Real Housewives\" series, our media culture revels in seeing women torn apart, whether relieved of their hair extensions or exposed for their flaws. A figure skater executing a perfectly graceful routine until the moment she slams into the ice satisfies this obsession perfectly. OK, so maybe Lang's whore metaphor is a bit too subtle. Strip away the sequins, wipe off the pancake makeup, delete the frozen-in-place smiles, and what's left is a tawdry whore of a sport where the judges are the johns. That's Toronto Star columnist Rosie DiManno, in a column complaining that the Canadian team of Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir came in second behind Americans Meryl Davis and Charlie White in the ice dancing competition. She proceeded to analyse the components of the top two finishers, concluding that the Canadians were the victims of a pro-US conspiracy. Some in the American media certainly think so, calling it a \" sore loser attitude \" and labelling DiManno as \" Canada's worst columnist \". The falls, the Byzantine judging process, and the occasional conspiracy theories and nasty spats - it's part of the whole spectacle that surrounds the combination of pure athleticism with art and emotion. (And get ready for another round of controversy, after Thursday night's women's individual competition, which gave Russian Adelina Sotnikova the gold over defending Olympic champion Yuna Kim of South Korea.) Ice skating brings out the best of our media culture - and the worst. And it's why it has been and likely always will be the big draw of the Winter Olympics.\n","660\n","Suzanne Collins\n","creating new bio\n","[0, 1]\n","is an American television writer and author.

TOP STORIES No question what Friday's biggest tale is and it is a blockbuster: too big for the Cycling Round-up section, in fact. After weeks of speculation, Sir Bradley Wiggins turned up on the BBC Breakfast sofa to do what Team Sky seemed unable to admit: he confirmed he will very probably not be on the Tour de France start line in Leeds. Given his fractious history with teammate Chris Froome, the criticism he received in Froome's recently published and serialised autobiography, his absence from Tour training camps and reconnaissance trips, and entirely different race schedule, we should perhaps not be at all surprised by this. Wiggins is the most famous, current British rider, on a British team, and the world's most famous bike race, that he became the first Brit to win only two years ago, is going to start in Britain without him. If you will recall, there was an element of controversy about this selection, too, as Yorkshire's organisers have decided - with the Tour owners' approval - to ramp up this event and charge punters to see it. With a cheapest ticket of PS45 plus booking charges, and posh seats at PS85+, many people wondered what could be added to a ceremony which is normally free to justify those prices. Well, how do the Brighouse Beatles, Embrace, sound to all you good, good people? And Alistair Griffin doing Tour anthem \"The Road\" with Kimberley Walsh on backing vocals? Throw in Opera North, Hope and Social, French star Pauline Vassuer, stunt-riders and lots of fancy lighting and I think you've got a reasonable night out. Formerly known as the Dauphine Libere, after the regional newspaper that created the race, it is a week-long stage race in south-east France, which makes it pretty bumpy. This year's event starts on Sunday with a short time trial in Lyon, which includes a 1.8km section on a new underground bike and pedestrian path, known as \"Le Tube\". After that, it is pretty much uphill, which makes this a great indicator for Le Tour. Chris Froome is the defending champion (Wiggins won the two previous editions), but chief rivals Alberto Contador and Vicenzo Nibali will be eager to seize the pre-Tour initiative from him. Also in the field are American duo Tejay Van Garderen and Andrew Talansky, and promising Pole Michal Kwiatkowski. TWEET OF THE DAY \"How can Bradley Wiggins end up being yellow jersey? Sign with @tinkoff_saxo and wear (yellow) all year long\" @tinkoff_saxo owner and social media addict Oleg Tinkov, whose team wear yellow and blue, opens transfer negotiations with the British cycling star. A TO Z OF LE TOUR W is for... Wada - Sadly, you simply cannot stage a Tour de France these days without the World Anti-Doping Agency getting involved, willingly or otherwise, at some point. You never know quite what the story will be (a big star testing positive, rumours of a new drug, fresh revelations from the past etc) but you know there will be one, and they normally break in on the Friday before it starts. Wheelsuckers - One of my favourites this, but I sense it is going out of fashion as people start to realise it is actually more common than they think, and entirely sensible. Basically, this is a pejorative term for a rider who sits behind his rivals, never leading, never attacking, just waiting. This is to do with the aerobic advantages of following somebody, but also a defensive mind-set. Recent winners such as Cadel Evans and Wiggins have been accused of doing this, but it was hardly surprising they would ride this way in the mountains given their strength as time-triallers.

Gaffe-prone Mr Biden made the remark in an interview on Friday with a prominent black radio host, Charlamagne Tha God, about his outreach to black voters. Throughout the 18-minute interview, Mr Biden, 77, stressed his longstanding ties to the black community, noting his overwhelming win this year in South Carolina's presidential primary, a state where the Democratic electorate is more than 60% African American. Mr Biden's gaffe came at the end of an interview, as he was being pressed on whether he favoured Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar over a black woman as his running mate. The diplomat is well-known to Biden, however, as she served in the Obama White House with him as national security adviser after a stint as the US representative to the United Nations. While there was some friction between the Sanders and Warren camps, Warren would still be a significant signal that Biden wants to reach out to his party's left wing - and govern as more of a progressive than he let on during the campaign. Even before the mass protests over the death of George Floyd made racial justice a top issue among voters, the black former chief-of-police from Orlando, Florida, was on the Biden team's radar as a possible vice-presidential pick. \"You'll miss us,\" she tells a journalist. While working for Mr Obama, Ms Rice became a lightning rod for controversy.

That has given him a political legacy that will long outlast his one term in office. Biden, thanks to Georgia, should have the opportunity to start rolling back some of those gains. Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson will no longer run the Government Oversight Committee, so his planned forays into Hunter Biden's China dealings and any connections to the incoming president will go away. Any new Democratic scandals that crop up should also avoid a full and potential politically damaging airing - a luxury Trump also enjoyed during his first two years in office and sorely missed during his final two.

Warnock, who is finishing the term of retired Senator Johnny Isakson, will have to run for re-election in just two years. US President Joe Biden has likened a new voting law in the state of Georgia to racist policies of the 20th Century US South, calling it an \"atrocity\".

According to analysis by St Louis Post-Dispatch investigative reporter Jeremy Kohler, video evidence does not show the protesters crossing onto the McCloskeys' property, remaining instead on the sidewalks and in the roadway.

All the lawsuits have so far been unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Mr Biden remains president-elect. In a news conference on Friday, Mr Trump said \"who knows\" which administration would be in power in the future. His refusal to concede has heightened concerns about the US government's ability, going forward, to tackle growing Covid-19 infection rates.

Jim Mattis, the then defence secretary, refined the policy to limit it to individuals with a history of gender dysphoria, or when a person's biological sex and identity do not match.

Mr Trump and his allies accuse Mr Biden of having acted to protect his son. Mr Lutsenko also said he had met Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who asked him if it was possible to investigate the Bidens in his country. Not only did he assert that there was nothing untoward about the former vice-president's dealings with Ukraine, but he expressed dismay to learn that when Trump administration officials were calling for investigations into Ukrainian energy company Burisma, they were really looking to damage the Democratic presidential hopeful.

Sgt Shavack said the gunman opened fire before passing through lobby metal detectors. Court officials said the building would be closed on Tuesday for investigation and repairs. Beau Biden, 45, said on Thursday he would not seek a third term as Delaware's attorney general. The same year, he suffered a mild stroke. Beau Biden was diagnosed with brain cancer in August 2013 and underwent treatment that was initially successful. However, the cancer recurred earlier this year. In 2010, Beau Biden suffered a mild stroke. Three years later, he received surgery at a Texas cancer centre for what was said to be a small lesion. The eldest of Mr Biden's two sons, he served a year-long tour of Iraq in 2008 as a captain in the Delaware National Guard. He was seen as a rising star of US politics but suffered from health problems in recent years. Beau Biden died at the end of last month from brain cancer, aged 46. Speculation about Joe Biden possibly entering into the 2016 presidential race reached a fevered pitch over the weekend - and the vice-president and his staff have done little to tamp down the talk since then. She also offered Howard Schultz, head of coffee shop empire Starbucks, as another possible Democratic contender. Mr Biden has a reputation as a skilled debate and capable campaigner who can connect with working voters. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Clinton campaign just announced it has a forthcoming $2 million (PS1.28 million) television advertising buy in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, featuring two spots touting their candidate's personal story. Mr Carter has ordered the military to review its procedures for protecting American troops inside the United States and to step up security at recruiting stations. When he and the president had lunch and discussed Beau Biden's declining health due to a stroke, Joe Biden revealed his concern about how his son, Delaware's attorney general, would support his family if he was unable to work. Months later, his father revealed he would not run for president in 2016. Malia, 19, opted to attend Harvard having taken a year gap after high school. In a video announcement, Mr Biden argued that the \"core values of the nation... our very democracy, everything that has made America America, is at stake\". \"With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it,\" Mr Biden said. \"I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign.\" No more theoretical discussions of how candidate x on day one looked compared to candidate y on day two. It was - at times - a bare-knuckle affair. \"It's not that they don't want to help - they don't know quite what to do. It was unfocused, meandering Biden at his debate worst. \"The way you deal with it is finding purpose, purpose in what you do,\" he said - in a way that probably reminded many Democrats of the wounded but strong man who suffered through Beau Biden's cancer in 2016. For the first time in years, however, Democrats were talking about aggressive new gun-control proposals - and none were doing so more vocally than Beto O'Rourke. In the past, that sort of sentiment was seen by many Democrats as political poison.\n","794\n","Doug Emhoff\n","creating new bio\n","[0, 1, 2, 4]\n","is an American lawyer currently serving as the Second Gentleman of the United States.

Mr Biden's deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield described the release of the returns as a \"historic level of transparency\", saying: \"Mr President, release your tax returns or shut up\". The new president and vice-president take an oath of office administered by the Supreme Court chief justice. By North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Donald Trump has previously said he will contest the results. Better nowadays than it was in 1800 when the first presidential couple John and Abigail Adams moved in - the building was unfinished. Mr Emhoff's lack of political experience has not been a hurdle on the trail. \"I think it all came very naturally to him, because Doug is naturally a people person.\" He has also become an \"incredibly forceful advocate\" for the Biden-Harris ticket, Mr Weingarten said, a role suited for the experienced litigator. As vice-president, Ms Harris will preside over the Senate, leaving Mr Emhoff in charge of convening lunches and events for the senators' spouses. Asked if Mr Emhoff was aware of the discussions regarding gender roles, Mr Jacoby laughed.

Within days of arriving at the White House, Mr Trump had chosen a portrait of populist president Andrew Jackson for the Oval Office. \"It's my last day,\" says one man, smiling as he took a photo of his sons on the north lawn. The officials were in high spirits, joking and vamping for the camera. \"Hopefully in the Greek isles or somewhere.\" Add it all up and Ms Harris' choice of pearls and a purple sharp-cut Christopher John Rogers coat was \"an excellent first building block on what the legacy is of how to look like a woman in power\", Ms Rothman says. \"He chose to do everything that he should, which is to not distract and perfectly fit in,\" says Rothman. From baring her arms to wearing both high-end and High Street fashion, Mrs Obama was \"legacy-making\" in a way that hearkened back to Nancy Reagan and Jackie Kennedy, Ms Rothman says. To Prof Stevens, it was almost crown-like. Prof Stevens' takeaway was: \"You need some gloves, young man.\" She has also interviewed each of Biden's potential cabinet nominees. Mr Biden is likely to model Ms Harris' role after his own time as vice-president. \"I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions,\" Mr Biden said. Firstly, it's crucial that the American public see the vice-president as competent, and able to take the reins as commander-in-chief at any moment.

Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Rihanna and Anne Hathaway are among the all-star cast in the heist movie, which is a reboot of the Ocean's 11 franchise. There are nods to previous films - Bullock and Blanchett effectively take on the roles of George Clooney and Brad Pitt as the two masterminds, while rapper and actress Awkwafina is an updated version of Matt Damon's gifted pickpocket. \"Anne Hathaway, however, is commanding at every moment; even her red-carpet myopia has awareness.\" But they've since had to row back on nearly all their time-saving decisions due to pressure from the film industry. \"During commercials, when people at the ceremony know they're not live on the air, they run around and talk to people, go to the bathroom, be a little loud, and that could've come across as disrespectful to the winners who are getting their awards during that time.\" There will also be a tightening up of the rules around acceptance speeches. Black Panther's popularity is perhaps one of the reasons the Academy attempted to introduce a new category this year to recognise more box office hits. It also would've meant yet another category to get through on the night - and most agree the Academy certainly doesn't need any more of those. American actress Linda Cardellini wore fuchsia taffeta on the red carpet. Dame Helen Mirren led the fashion pack in a vibrant Schiaparelli gown, complete with multi-toned pink chiffon and some seriously sparkling jewels.

Ms Kim, 30, was referred to as a senior party official three years ago. However, the warm veneration of Kim Jong-suk is not reflective of how the average woman is treated in North Korea. Kim Yo-jong's promotion to the party politburo last year, and her selection as envoy to the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea, are evidence of her increasing importance and her secure position at the highest level of the leadership in Pyongyang. South Korea has had to ask the UN for an exemption to allow Choe Hwi, a UN sanctioned North Korean official, to attend. Correspondents say the invitation puts Mr Moon in a difficult position as he campaigned on a promise to engage with the North, but his moves in that direction go contrary to the wishes of his US ally Earlier, US Vice-President Mike Pence briefly encountered Kim Yong-nam at the Games but the two tried to avoid directly facing each other, Yonhap news agency reports.\n","It turns out North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un doesn't need to fire off a missile to get the world's attention.

The sudden pressure on propaganda may seem like a surprise, but Pyongyang's efforts make sense when seen against the recent failure of US-North Korea talks. As well as being on the State Affairs Commission, he is Premier of the Cabinet, a moderately influential position.

It was notable that once again, in the aftermath of the explosion, state media made reference to \"human scum\" - their description of North Korean defectors in the South. But earlier this month, the North expressed its anger at the cross-border propaganda and then cut all communication with the South. Speaking at a meeting of the politburo on Tuesday, Mr Kim, who was smoking a cigarette, said there were \"some shortcomings\" in the state's efforts to keep out the \"malignant virus\", state media reported, without giving details.

Mr Trump appears to be calculating that the American public will determine that, after Orlando, the status quo is untenable; that he has the upper-hand in a contest between his unprecedented border-security and immigration proposals and Mrs Clinton's calls for moderation, continuation of Mr Obama's foreign policy and increased regulation of firearms.\n","One of Star Trek's best known characters, Hikaru Sulu, has been revealed as gay.

A New York Times/Siena College poll at the end of June found 67% of US voters trusted Dr Fauci regarding the pandemic, with just 26% expressing trust in Mr Trump. Dr Fauci's comments come after reports that as of 15 July, US hospitals will have to report Covid-19 patient data to the federal health agency in Washington instead of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). \"This issue of tweeting and retweeting is something that I've never understood or gotten involved in,\" Dr Fauci told BBC News on Wednesday.\n","This has been a busy week for fact-checkers looking into false and misleading claims about the coronavirus pandemic.

Investigators say they have already linked him to 34 murders and are working to corroborate many others. The murder convictions led to Little being referred to the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) - a scheme that works to analyse serial offenders of violent and sexual crimes, and share information with local law enforcement agencies to cross-reference unsolved crimes. A local ranger, James Holland, then travelled to California with ViCAP team members earlier this year to interview Little. They say Little agreed to talk to them because he was hoping to move prisons. They believe Little particularly targeted marginalised and vulnerable women who were involved in prostitution or addicted to drugs. \"He got off over and over and over again,\" she told the newspaper. The FBI says the 78-year-old is \"in poor health\" and is likely to now remain in prison in Texas until his death, where he was transferred from California after admitting the Odessa killing. The FBI has released the portraits a serial killer drew of his victims in the hope that they can be identified. Little was first caught in 2012 when he was arrested on a drugs charge in a homeless shelter in Kentucky, and extradited to California. Once he was in police custody in Los Angeles, officers carried out DNA testing on him. He pleaded not guilty at trial, but was eventually convicted and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences, with no chance of parole. ViCAP, tasked with doing a full background check on Little, noticed that the three LA killings were very similar to a number of unsolved deaths dating back to the 1970s. In spring last year, investigators set up an interview with Little, hoping to find out more information. Knowing that he wanted to move prisons, they struck a deal - he could move prisons if he talked. Once he was done, he had confessed to 90 killings. But he was unable to remember specific dates - which, investigators say, has caused further issues with identifying the victims. Agents are continuing to question Little and collect drawings of his victims. He has been serving life in prison since 2012 for the murders of three women. Little targeted vulnerable individuals, mostly black women, many of whom were sex workers or drug users, officials say. Some bodies have never been found, the agency said. \"For many years, Samuel Little believed he would not be caught because he thought no one was accounting for his victims,\" FBI crime analyst Christie Palazzolo said in the statement. Law enforcement is still working to verify the remaining 43 cases he confessed to. In one of the five cases the FBI is seeking public assistance to solve, Little describes meeting a young black transgender woman named Marianne or Mary Ann in Miami, Florida, in the early 70s. \"I turned her loose and she fell into it face down.\" After murdering her, he drove to the outskirts of the city and rolled her body down a slope. It is unclear if Little will face more charges over the recent confessions. Little was arrested in 2012 on a drugs charge in Kentucky and extradited to California, where officers carried out DNA testing on him. Little already had an extensive criminal record, with offences from armed robbery to rape across the US. The DNA results linked him to three unsolved murders from 1987 and 1989 in Los Angeles County. A former competitive boxer, Little would knock his victims out with punches before strangling them - meaning that there were not always obvious signs, like stab or bullet wounds, the person had been murdered.\n","838\n","Jeffrey Epstein\n","creating new bio\n","[0, 3, 6, 12]\n","was an American financier and convicted sex offender.

In his interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme in November 2019, the duke said he did not regret his friendship with Epstein, despite the financier having been convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution in 2008. The duke's lawyers described the request as \"disappointing\" because the Duke of York was \"not a target of the DoJ investigation and has recently repeated his willingness to provide a witness statement\".\n","A cardboard cut-out of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was spotted in the stands of Nottingham Forest's City Ground.

Amy Klobuchar, on the other hand, has been a non-factor during many of these debates. In September, he was accused of tossing an ageist gibe at Democratic front-runner Joe Biden during a televised debate in Texas when he accused the 77-year-old former US vice-president of being forgetful. While Obama spent much of his speech talking about his former vice-president, he opened by launching the first salvo in what is sure to be an increasingly acrimonious war of words with the man who replaced him in the Oval Office.

As the swirl of legal drama around Donald Trump grows, it will be increasingly difficult for Democrats to avoid direct questions about the \"I word\" - impeachment - even if the topic makes many on the left squirm with discomfort. Ranked the world's richest man, Mr Bezos has not been an active political campaign donor thus far, US media say. Mr Soros, the target of the first package, branded Mr Trump \"an imposter, a [political] conman and a would-be dictator\" during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last year. \"We have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican party.\" US media have described Mr Steyer's campaign as the Democratic version of Mr Trump's; both men are political outsiders with vast personal wealth, running on the premise of changing the existing system. On several occasions, the New Jersey senator expressed frustration that the candidates on the stage were spending too much time attacking each other. Biden has failed to turn his high name recognition and ties to still-popular former President Barack Obama into electoral and fund-raising dominance, and he's been nagged with concerns about his age and endurance. That track record isn't entirely a blessing, however, as a focus on the Middle East has once again turned attention to Biden's support for the 2003 Iraq War - and his sometimes muddled defence of it.\n","Elizabeth Warren accused rival Bernie Sanders of calling her a liar at the end of a Democratic candidates' TV debate, according to a newly released recording. Unlike 2016, when Hillary Clinton largely avoided confronting the Vermont senator for fear of alienating his supporters, his opponents will have no such reluctance this time. While Biden hasn't spent as much time touting his environmental plan, it is - on paper - at least as extensive. Mr Steyer's numbers in South Carolina suggest he may be drawing African-American voters away from Mr Biden - something Mr Biden himself has pointed out, blaming \"the amount of money being spent by the billionaires\". After Biden's event, Mack Smith - an African American who is retired - said he was torn between Biden and Tom Steyer, the California hedge-fund billionaire who has invested considerably time and money in courting the black vote in the state, but that Clyburn's testimonial \"carries as a lot of weight\". \"I feel that he'll do a good job,\" says Penny Henderson of Taylor, who attended the Reverend Al Sharpton's candidate forum on Wednesday morning.

To put that into context, 34% of delegates will be awarded on Super Tuesday when 14 states hold their nominating contests on 3 March.

The comedy ventriloquist performed more than 200 shows last year thanks to his five-year contract with the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. The Top 10 male-dominated list ranks the Canadian Russell Peters, one of the world's most successful touring comics, in third place. Ventriloquist Jeff Dunham, who topped the list in 2010, is at four with $19m (PS12.6m), with Louis CK debuting at five. The Emmy winner made $16m (PS10.6m) after selling tickets to his shows directly through his website, instead of through ticket retailers. Also appearing on the chart areKevin Hart, Larry the Cable Guy and George Lopez. To make the list, the comics' primary source of income has to be from ticket sales. The pre-tax figures were compiled after Forbes spoke to agents, solicitors and other industry insiders to estimate earnings between 1 June 2012 and 1 June 2013. The Liverpudlian, who will perform a sold-out show at Sydney Opera House on Wednesday night as part of his Australian tour, has made it into the top ten for the first time. \"Like the others on the list, most of John's money comes from touring,\" said Madeline Berg from Forbes. \"While he only made 12 stops during our scoring period, his gross at each was astronomical - one of the highest on our list. \"He is one of few comedians to routinely play large venues, having graduated from the more standard club and theatre scene,\" she said, adding that his annual Christmas special for the BBC also gave his earnings a big boost. In third place with $21.5m is ventriloquist and impressionist Terry Fator - a former winner of America's Got Talent who has been dubbed \"the human jukebox\". Forbes' highest-earning comedian Seinfeld previously topped the list in 2013 for the third year in a row, although there was no list in 2014. Seinfeld's earnings also took him to number 62 in the magazine's Celebrity 100 earlier this year. Second place Hart was the only other comedian to make the Celebrity 100. His earnings rocketed this year thanks to films such as Think Like a Man Too and The Wedding Ringer, alongside the millions made from his 48 live shows. The Emmy Award-winning comedian tweeted the top 10 of Forbes' list along with the words: \"No Women.\" Jerry Seinfeld topped the rankings with estimated earnings of $57.5m (PS45.3m). Amy Schumer was the first woman to make the list last year but has dropped back out this time. Ricky Gervais is the only British comedian on the list. He is a new entry in fifth place with earnings of $25m (PS19.7m). Forbes said that was thanks to Humanity, his first stand-up tour for five years. Humanity was also on Netflix, and he has signed up for another Netflix special. Griffin, meanwhile, was unlikely to make the list herself.

But the gasp of surprise at Olivia Colman beating Glenn Close to best actress was eclipsed only by an even bigger gasp of surprise a few minutes later, when Green Book beat Roma to best picture. It turned out to be especially fitting as Bohemian Rhapsody, the biopic of the band, ended up going home with four trophies - the most of any film on the night. The guest presenters were a huge success Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were widely praised during their three years fronting the Golden Globes for adding some much needed sarcasm and cynicism to awards season, which can often feel pretentious and self-important. Lady Gaga got deep about Shallow All eyes were on Lady Gaga as she took to the stage halfway through the ceremony, kindly bringing her co-star Bradley Cooper with her for a live performance of Shallow, their duet from A Star Is Born. \"There were so many things I did not anticipate, that broke me, that tortured me, that traumatised me.

Olivia Colman will be sleeping with her Oscar Olivia Colman was the unexpected winner of best actress, an award which had been widely expected to go to Glenn Close. \"This is hilarious, I've got an Oscar,\" Colman said through tears and genuine surprise, reflecting the reaction of the audience. \"I've just been told I completely forgot Melissa [McCarthy] and Yalitza [Aparicio], but it's not an everyday occurrence, so I don't know how anyone is composed and remembers everything.\" Asked where she will keep her Oscar, Colman replied: \"In bed with me.

The Academy confirmed the news in a tweet that indicated the show would still have stars, performances and surprises. \"Remember when a movie was a fella in a hat running away from a fella with no hair?\" When Hank Hooper, CEO of media conglomerate Kabletown, made that observation in Tina Fey's sitcom 30 Rock, it was a parody of the outmoded opinions held by the men who run Hollywood. And as you watched this year's ceremony, there was an ever-so-slightly awkward feeling that the Academy was trying to make up for that pre-event controversy. Janelle Monae started the evening with a performance of It's a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, from the Tom Hanks movie of the same name, which became an old-time musical special. \"Those voices long deprived,\" observed Monae, before rhyming the title of Bong Joon-ho's Parasite with \"the Oscars, it's so white\". She signed off by telling the audience: \"We celebrate the women. I'm so proud to stand here as a black, queer woman.\" On to the main ceremony... And for the second year in a row, the show went without a host. This year's awards were kicked off by Steve Martin and Chris Rock, who were fine but no more than that. Rock sarcastically pointed to the Academy's progress in 91 years: \"Back in 1929 there were no black acting nominees. And now in 2020 there is one black acting nominee.\" And so the night continued in this slightly laboured vein. The rapper had not even turned up when the song, from his semi-autobiographical movie 8 Mile, won an Oscar back in 2003. The feed captured the expressions of Billie Eilish and Martin Scorsese - not knowing and not caring respectively - which will surely be new Oscar gifs.

BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was a \"strong indication that they don't want to bring him up as a formal 'royal'\".

The son of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has been christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a private ceremony. The Sunday Express urges its readers to \"forget that Royal christening row\" over the decision of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to exclude the public and press from the ceremony. \"If we're having open-top bus tours round Trafalgar Square for finishing fourth, that's sending totally the wrong message to my players.\" \"I know that she will be unbelievably good at the job part of it,\" said Harry. This was to be no repeat of the Duchess of Cambridge's birth with the circus of journalists and photographers lying in wait outside hospital doors for days on end. Downing Street has so far said that questions on the duke and duchess's announcement are \"for the royal household\". This is their choice as opposed to a course of action they have no option but to follow.

The Emmy-nominated actor received the 2,482nd star at a ceremony on Hollywood Boulevard on Monday, in the same week NCIS began its 10th season. Harmon has played Leroy Jethro Gibbs in the CBS drama since 2003. After a brief career as an American football player, Harmon has had a variety of roles in television, film and on stage and has been twice nominated for an Emmy award. \"If this means anything to me, it represents longevity.\" Mr Britt sent Time Warner Cable's proposal in a letter to CBS chief executive Les Moonves which was made public. Moffett Research analyst Craig Moffett said he did not expect CBS to accept this latest proposal. \"The economics of that would never be as attractive as the current model, where everyone has to pay whether they want the service or not.'\" Since the 1992 Cable Act, content owners have been able to demand higher fees or cancel their signal. As a result, TV operators have usually been forced to pay higher rates or risk losing subscribers to satellite TV companies. The chief executive of CBS said that the US TV network will \"probably\" sign a deal with Apple TV. \"We will probably do a deal with Apple TV,\" Mr Moonves said during a conference. Mr Moonves, 68, told the magazine that he \"may have made some women uncomfortable\" in the past. CBS' stock price dropped by 6% on Friday as reports of the New Yorker article trickled out. Six women have made allegations against him, including the actress Illeana Douglas who told the New Yorker that he violently kissed her. All of the women say they believe their careers suffered because they rejected his advances. A CBS statement on behalf of Mr Moonves said he acknowledged trying to kiss Ms Douglas but denied sexual assault and intimidation. Earlier this year, CBS' fired veteran presenter Charlie Rose, who was accused of sexual harassment by a number of women, including several CBS employees. But his tenure at the top of the network, which he joined in 1995, has been marked by a power struggle with Shari Redstone who, through her family's business National Amusements, is the controlling shareholder in both CBS and the media conglomerate, Viacom. Mr Moonves, who is chairman and chief executive of CBS, told the New Yorker he regretted \"immensely\" having \"made some women uncomfortable\" in the past. They appear in a new article in the New Yorker by Ronan Farrow, who also authored the July piece and this year shared a Pulitzer Prize for detailing assault accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. In my 40 years of work, I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations.\" Mr Fager himself denies harassment, and told reporters he had been fired over a \"harsh\" text he sent to a colleague. On Wednesday's CBS News evening broadcast, reporter Jericka Duncan read the texts that Mr Fager sent to her after she had asked for his response to allegations of inappropriate touching at company parties. CBS added: \"Employees also cited past incidents in which human resources and the company did not hold high performers accountable for their conduct and protect employees from retaliation.\" Ms Carroll says she did not report the alleged attack at the time after being advised by a friend she had no chance of winning in court. Ms Carroll ends the article by saying Mr Trump was her \"last hideous man\" and she has not had sex since then. \"I've never met this person in my life,\" the US president said in a statement.

This is one of those few projects that a whole studio comes together with lots of passion.\" The film took more than $25m (PS19.6m) at the box office over the weekend, which appears to validate the filmmakers' decision to turn down a lucrative Netflix deal in favour of a riskier cinema release through a Hollywood studio. He has since issued an \"absolute\" denial of the other allegations that later emerged. Author Kevin Kwan, whose book of the same name was adapted into the movie, also congratulated Wu and the cast on the \"historic nomination\". It was lauded by many and considered to be a big win for Asian-American representation in Hollywood. US awards season is in full swing - and so is the debate around representation (and a gaping lack thereof) in Hollywood. Anecdotally, it seems that films featuring women - in front of the camera or behind the scenes - gain serious critical acclaim. Some advocates are hoping proof of profitability will show industry executives that female representation matters. Amy Pascal, the former Sony Pictures chair who led the joint research team, said in a statement: \"This is powerful proof that audiences want to see everyone represented on screen.\" \"It's not news to anyone who studies this industry that women-led movies do well at the box office,\" says Melissa Silverstein, film industry expert and founder of the Women and Hollywood advocacy group. Though the playing field is still far from even, to Ms Silverstein, the future looks bright. Ms Silverstein says it is not entirely correct to pin the increase in women on screen to movements like #MeToo and Time's Up, as most of the female-led endeavors garnering praise now began production years prior. Prof Martha Lauzen, director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, told the BBC the data still does not show much improvement for women in Hollywood over the last two decades, despite the hubbub of recent movements. \"But the whole thing is just: hire women.\" Sandra Oh has hailed the diversity at this year's Golden Globe Awards as she became the first woman of Asian descent ever to host the show. In an opening monologue she praised the \"faces of change\" she saw in Hollywood, saying the \"moment is real\". Because I see you... all these faces of change. Others, like Olivia Colman, take the time to thank their nearest and dearest. \"Be heroes of your own stories\" - Constance Wu When chatting to Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet, Wu described Crazy Rich Asians as a \"historic\" moment, as it saw a major studio telling a story centred on her experience as an Asian-American. \"And the fact that I'm celebrating him and this story with you is proof that we're longing for stories like this.\" He also embraced being \"the son of immigrants from Egypt\" and a \"first-generation American\". \"Having the dream is easy, making it come true is hard.\" The film, which also stars Constance Wu and Julia Stiles alongside Lizzo and Cardi B in smaller roles, is based on a true story and was inspired by a New York Magazine article that went viral in 2015. More from Toronto: While Hustlers is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival, where many films battle for Oscar attention, this is a movie which is realistically likely to do better at the box office than in awards season. \"It's a classic underdog story,\" said The Hollywood Reporter. \"Though there is still much work to be done, this class looks more like an actual jury of our PEERS than ever before, so that's a step in the right direction.\"\n","978\n","Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n","creating new bio\n","[0, 1, 2, 7]\n","is an American political pundit and politician, who served as the 31st White House press secretary for President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2019, the third woman to serve in that position.

He eventually responded, hitting out at \"trolls\" and suggesting they pay attention to comedian and late-night TV host Stephen Colbert, who was this week accused of homophobia after a crude joke about President Donald Trump. \"I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money,\" he said. A former member of the Trump transition team, he mistakenly suggested to the BBC in January that Elton John would play at the new president's inauguration. Spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders also said the president had not wanted to burden new Chief of Staff Gen John Kelly with \"that line of succession\" - a reference to Mr Scaramucci's boast of reporting directly to the president, rather than to his chief of staff. Although the president had defended Mr Bannon as \"not a racist\", saying he had received an unfair press, Mr Trump said \"we'll see what happens\" about him. Mr Kudlow has defended the new tariffs and said his boss should not be blamed for trade tensions. Yet she does not say that the report is inaccurate.

In Mr Pence's interview with NBC on Tuesday, he sought to clarify the president's original claim, saying \"that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents\".

After her appointment, former President Bill Clinton's press secretary Joe Lockhart shared a 2012 tweet from McEnany where she said Mr Obama's brother was in \"that hut in Kenya\". Yet it was striking to see them go about their daily lives in a way that seemed largely unaffected by the virus. The fact that she has tested positive is a reminder of just how dangerous - and contagious - the virus is. It is also a reminder that conveying the president's message through words and actions - whether about the virus or other matters - is a risky undertaking Ms McEnany works alongside Alyssa Farah, the White House's director of strategic communications and Ben Williamson, senior communications adviser.

All 10 Democratic senators on the committee have called on President Trump to \"immediately withdraw\" Mr Kavanaugh's nomination. Thanks in large part to a disjointed format that featured five-minute segments alternating between veteran sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, a surrogate questioner for the Republicans, and Democratic senators, there was little flow to proceedings after Dr Ford's powerful opening. Judge Kavanaugh's appointment would tilt the balance in favour of conservatives for years to come.\n","President Donald Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against his nominee for the US Supreme Court. A third woman who has also publicly accused Judge Kavanaugh, Julie Swetnick, alleges he was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. Quoting an unnamed senior US official, NBC reported that the FBI's witness list does not include Julie Swetnick, the third accuser to come forward with a claim against Judge Kavanaugh. Senator Dianne Feinstein says that she believes the White House limited the scope of the investigation into allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n","Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court seat looks all but confirmed after he won the backing of key senators despite an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations. On Saturday, when Brett Kavanaugh's position on the Supreme Court was confirmed by the Senate, an idea spread on social media - postcards for Professor Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him. Prof Ford has been unable to return to her home due to \"unending\" death threats and on Monday President Donald Trump said the professor's claims were \"all made up.\" Christine Blasey Ford testified before Congress that he had sexually assaulted her in the 1980s, while Deborah Ramirez told The New Yorker magazine that he had waved his penis in front of her face at a 1980s dormitory party.\n","758\n","Lily James\n","creating new bio\n","[0, 1, 2, 3]\n","is an English actress.

Despite changing its management and restructuring, it has a reputation that will be hard to live down, with or without Elizabeth Holmes. There is a certain lifestyle that goes with such bold claims - and she was living it. Ms Williams wrote in her article about being seduced by the apparent \"glamorous, frictionless\" lifestyle. However, Sorokin was acquitted of the charge related to that bill. \"People love to think they are idiosyncratic, but this has happened over and over and over again, everywhere. \"You often don't know who is on the other side of a transaction, and people do buy things they can't afford,\" she says. \"No-one died as a result of her actions, she just made rich people look like idiots,\" it said.

A \"life rights\" deal does not mean other people can't tell the story - which has multiple perspectives - but it gives the company free rein and ensures Sorokin cannot assist the competition.
