husband of one of the Conservative Party's biggest donors was secretly funded by a Russian oligarch with close ties to President Putin. Leaked files show her husband received $8m (PS6.1m). The money initially came from a politician facing US sanctions due to his closeness to the Kremlin. Her lawyers say the donations are not tainted by Kremlin influence. Advertisement A leak of banks' \"suspicious activity reports\" - called the FinCEN Files and seen by BBC Panorama - shows Vladimir Chernukhin was sent the money in 2016 from a British Virgin Islands company linked to Suleyman Kerimov. Billionaire Mr Kerimov is a member of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. He has been under investigation in France over allegations of tax fraud since 2016. Mr Chernukhin, 52, is a former deputy minister of finance under Vladimir Putin, who left Russia for London in 2004 after being sacked by the president. The Chernukhins - one of the UK's most prominent Russian-born couples - are now both British citizens and live in London. Mrs Chernukhin's donations to the Conservative Party began in 2012. Mrs Chernukhin's donations to the Tories have given her access to figures at the top of UK government. In return for PS135,000 she was invited to a ladies' night dinner at a luxury hotel with Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet in April 2019. She is pictured above, fourth from the right. And the 47-year-old has twice made winning bids at auction for tennis matches with Boris Johnson. The last, in February this year, cost her PS45,000. As of this year she is the biggest female donor in British history to the Tories. According to Electoral Commission records, she has given about PS1.7m in total over the past eight years, including PS335,000 between last January and July. When in 2018, Boris Johnson - then foreign secretary - was asked about the Chernukhins and the PS160,000 tennis match donation, he told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"If there is evidence of gross corruption in the way that gentleman... obtained his wealth... then it's possible for our law enforcement agencies to deprive him of his wealth.\" But he added \"all possible checks have been made and... will continue to be made\" on donations. The $8m payment to Mr Chernukhin was made by an offshore company called Definition Services, which was controlled by Mr Kerimov's children. The documents show their funding came from their father and it was Mr Kerimov who had the personal relationship with Mr Chernukhin. As Deutsche Bank was processing the money, it sent questions to officials at another bank involved in the transaction. Despite the response, Deutsche Bank filed a suspicious activity report (SAR), noting the link to Mr Kerimov and the payment to Mr Chernukhin. Deutsche said Definition was \"registered and banking out of high risk jurisdictions and the commercial purpose of the transactions and the relationship between the parties could not be determined\". She is listed as a director of four UK companies. They added all her donations have been declared in accordance with Electoral Commission rules. Lawyers for Suleyman Kerimov said he denies all the allegations made by Panorama, and had \"no dealings with Ms Chernukhin whatsoever\". A Conservative Party spokesperson said: \"There are people in this country of Russian origin who are British citizens and have the democratic right to donate to a political party. Many have been vocal critics of Putin and it is completely wrong and discriminatory to smear them all with the same brush.\" The files were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 400 journalists around the world. <|sep|> Suleyman Kerimov <|sep|> Suleyman Kerimov\n","\n","actual_summary\n","\n","Suleyman Kerimov is a Russian billionaire businessman, philanthropist and politician of Lezgian origin.

Another of the most astute and nuanced experts on North Korea is similarly unconvinced by Kim Jong-un's performance in his first three years in the job. Given the escalating war of words between the US and North Korea, and Donald Trump's warning of \"fire and fury\" if Kim Jong-un overtly threatens the United States or launches missiles against the US territory of Guam, it is unclear how useful diplomacy is as tool for moderating regional tensions.

But it quotes Moscow Carnegie Centre director Dmitry Trenin as saying that \"this puts President Obama in a difficult situation\" because it \"seriously narrows the base that the USA can draw on to continue to talk with Russia\". However, analyst Nikolay Zlobin is quoted as saying the president's move was conditioned by his own former career as a spy: \"For him, Snowden is a traitor at least as far as corporate ethics go.

State TV has also played its part in creating a hostile atmosphere towards journalists. But Silicon Valley companies are preparing themselves for a backlash against this attitude. Globally, Telegram has played a central role in Islamic State's communication strategy, in part because of a channel feature that lets users broadcast to an unlimited number of other users.

It is thought to be for his 22-year-old daughter, Ekaterina Rybolovleva. However, the apartment is not even thought to be the most expensive US property in Mr Rybolovlev's portfolio. But professional wealth watchers say it has bounced back with a vengeance and is now almost entirely detached from the ups and downs of the conventional housing market or, arguably, reality. \"Once you get to the ultra luxury end of real estate you are operating in a different market. Other properties which routinely get mentioned in lists of the most expensive properties are industrialist Ira Rennert's 63-acre waterfront estate, in the Hamptons, New York, which is thought to be worth $180m (PS114m), and Donald Trump's $125m (PS79m) Maison de l'Amitie, in Palm Beach, Florida. Like Mr Milner, she does not intend to use it as her main residence. \"It's quite strong because there is so little inventory. \"If we don't know who they are, if we haven't heard their name, then most likely they are not a candidate,\" says Mr Hyland. In September 2010, brothers Nick and Christian Candy - the English property developers behind One Hyde Park - sold a penthouse apartment in Monaco to an unnamed Middle Eastern investor for $314m (PS198m). Billionaire Russian tycoon and Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, is also a fan of the Cote d'Azur, which like Switzerland has seen a boom in high-end property prices in the past few years. Villa La Leopolda, the 10-acre estate he is thought to have purchased from Microsoft mogul Bill Gates for $450m (PS284m) is often described in the media as the world's most expensive house. But the truth is we will never know for sure. However, the past couple of seasons have seen exciting developments with clubs Paris Saint-Germain and AS Monaco being bought by wealthy overseas owners. \"So the tax advantage that Monaco has is considered as unfair [by the clubs], especially in a period of economic difficulties for all clubs except Paris Saint-Germain,\" says Mr Haddouche. If not, they face possible suspension from the league. However, unsurprisingly, AS Monaco is not happy with this development, and has taken the matter to the French courts. A convention between France and the principality does mean that French players employed by the football club do have to pay their taxes in France. And Ms Moyersoen says that this fact might be one way around the tax issue, by looking at the number of French players employed by the club, with some sort of player quota requirement being a possible solution. The Geneva court's verdict means Dmitry Rybolovlev, the owner of French football team AS Monaco, will lose around half of his estimated fortune.
